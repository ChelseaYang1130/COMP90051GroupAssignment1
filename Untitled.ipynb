It was amazing.\\n\\nWhile EVERYTHING on the menu looks excellent, I had the white truffle scrambled eggs vegetable skillet and it was tasty and delicious.

I\\'m pretty sure they only use ingredients from their garden and blend them fresh when you order it.  It was amazing.\\n\\nWhile EVERYTHING on the menu looks excellent, I had the white truffle scrambled eggs vegetable skillet and it was tasty and delicious.  It came with 2 pieces of their griddled bread with was amazing and it absolutely made the meal complete.  It was the best \"toast\" I\\'ve ever had.\\n\\nAnyway, I can\\'t wait to go back!',\n",

Other than that it was good. \\n\\nMy Friend ordered the Green Chile Stew and The Green Chile Mac and Cheese (see pics) She has been here before so knew what she liked. I tasted the macaroni and thought it was pretty good too.\\n\\nI\\'ll give 3 stars until I go back and try out some other things.',\n",

Better then Dennys but not as good as Mimi's. \\n\\nI had the all u can eat of beef ribs, lasagna, meat loaf, cat fish, chicken, mashed and diced potatoes, stuffing, rice, homemade apple pie, etc and salad bar. I know I am missing a bunch of stuff they had but you get the drift. \\n\\nThey run specials on Prime rib and stuff so you might want to call to see what they are serving the night you go.\",\n",

Sorta reminds me of Sugar Bowl only smaller, not as busy, and easier parking.\\n\\nThe menu is ginormous.  I couldn't decide what to get but that didn't matter because the other 3 people I went with chose for me.  I wanted something basic but they insisted on sharing the 'patte' thing.  It is a few scoops of ice cream over a brownie and topped with whip cream and caramel.  While it was very good it just wasn't what I wanted.  Next time I'm just going to get a scoop or 2 of the ice cream so I can really taste what the ice cream is all about.  It is just too difficult to tell when it is topped with a bunch of stuff.  The ice cream we got on the brownie though (butter brittle I think) was excellent.  They have tons of different flavors and they all sound delish!\\n\\nAnyway I can't wait to go back if I am ever in the area again and need a sugar rush!\",\n",

Place was empty at 9am on a Tuesday morning but the atmosphere was casual, this place is pretty much been here for as long as I can remember and I am one of the 2 people that are native to Phoenix.  I always felt it was pricey but I think inflation has caught up since prices seemed normal when I went yesterday.  I loved the chips and salsa, the hot sauce is fantastic with a great spicy kick.  I went with the recommendation of the chile relleno which isn't my favorite but I like going with what waiters say so I gave it a try.  It was great!  Very flavorful and they just put it on the eggs so you can eat it together, the tortillas are fresh and home-made tasting, the hash browns and beans were good too.  I read my newspaper and drank my soda while I enjoyed the whole place to myself....oh yeah, I read some Yelp reviews and bookmarked my next stop too, ha ha.\",\n",

The store in general is pretty cool, there are lots of neat things in here from stationery to clothes to jewelry to baby stuff to dog stuff to vintage stuff.  There is a lot of stuff here.  It's all quite pricey though.  The sales they have every now and then are sorta okay, but still break the bank if you buy anything.  Overall they carry good quality products and the staff is super friendly and helpful.  I can't hate on a place too bad just because I can't afford it.\",\n",
       " 'It is romantic here even if you are with just friends. The waitress kneels at the couch to speak with you, pour your wine, bring your check...I love that...its so 5 star and respectful. Our waitress was so friendly and I was on cloud 9 because the whole ambience made my evening so nice. I love the darkness of it, its all so exotic and relaxing there especially with all the coves and different areas to be seated. Apparently you have to put your name down if you want a table for certain as it seems to be packed anytime I have been there. We needed one more bar stool-we had no reservation and the waiter actually went \"out to the storage\" to get us one. Impressive!',\n",

I can literally walk to this place :)  Okay, the Pho Tai is great here....I got the combination once and it wasn't as good.  I love the decor here lots and lots of old photos of Vietnam.  Service is always good here and I've been here when their busy and when it's slow.  If you need a Pho fix I would definitely recommend this place!\",\n",

I like corn crunchy and it was not. \\n\\nService was great. \\n\\nI did see an unmentionable bug running around near the back entrance towards the chicken rotisserie thing, but bugs have to eat too right? (still 5 stars lol)',\n",

Not behind a bullet proof pawn shop set up.  LOL!  The concession area was huge with mutliple lines open.  Not much of a wait either.  \\n\\nWalked into theater #10, not too shabby.  Pretty big screen and clean seats.  The speakers sounded great.  I had a great time.',\n",
       " \"This is simply a poor substitute for the Los Dos Molinos in South Phoenix.  It is a pale shade of itself.  The salsa is spicy, but it doesn't have any of the same excitement.  I think its partly the downtown location in a strip mall, (not that 98% of restaurants in Phoenix aren't in strip malls).  But the Mexcian Pizza and Chicken enchiladas just didn't have the same loving kick and spice.  When you are craving Mexican downtown, this'll do in a pinch.  But make room and time to head out to the original deal, the one with 5 alarm salsa and huge patios.  Margaritas the size of one's head and bring a group of friends to indulge!\",\n",
       " 'Went there for a second time on Sunday.  The first time I came, I was underwhelmed.  I think the problem was that I went with only one other and this time I came with 5 others.  It was a beautiful Sunday afternoon and over pitchers of Sangria ($20.00 specials on Sunday) and copious amounts of food I rediscovered the restorative quality of good food and great friends.  Had serrano ham and manchego with quince paste, pollo colonial (my favorite), lamb with mustard and mint, pan con tomate, quail with lentils and chicken drumettes.  With the exception of the drumettes (which tasted like overly fancy buffalo wings), the rest of the food was exceptional.  Small portions, yes.  A smidge pricey yet, but the communal feeling of being with your good friends in the open air sharing vino and small plates is priceless.',\n",
       " \"Gils.. A relatively new business to the complex on 16th St and Bell Rd. \\n\\nGils is NOT your average Mexican Style food. It is New Mexican Style. They use whole beans, no lard and light on flavor. The rice is not orange but more of a yellow with hints of garlic infused. The burritos are covered in red or green sauce, which can be a hot or mild depending on the crop. \\n\\nI had the pork Carnita's burrito topped with green sauce. Beans and rice. I would have been disappointed it I expected smashed refried beans too. BUT I love the beans as they are. They are sort of like a ham hock style bean. The carnitas was wonderful and huge. filled with pork and not a spec of fat in it. Topped with cheese and Hatch Green Chilie sauce. Did I mention Huge? \\n\\nThe whole meal including water and chips and salsa set me back $10 bucks. I even have a small lunch for tomorrow. The chips are homemade and the thicker type. The red salsa was spicy but not hot and green was good. \\n\\nThe rest of the menu looked good, nothing stood out as a must have but I will be back. \\n\\nThe place was clean and they made a nice patio outside, complete with waterfall and everything.\",\n",

They have all the best brands in cosmetics, skin care and perfume and they're always adding new items to their extensive product selection.  To me, getting a gift card to Sephora is like having Christmas morning over and over again.  Everywhere you look there are sparkly blushes, lip plumping glosses, lash-extending mascaras and anti-aging face creams- what more could anyone ask for? I can understand why men might hate going into Sephora- but they do have some products for guys too- although not many.  As far as I know, Scottsdale Fashion Square is home to the only Sephora in Scottsdale, but even as great as it is, it still can't beat the one right on the strip in Vegas.  They're open really late and you can shop with a drink in your hand- what could be better than that?\",\n",

I've eaten wings here with a couple Harps and have had a decent time.\\n\\nSurprisingly good is their seared ahi tuna.  It is pretty weird to think an Irish pub would do this well, but they do.

I should have just ordered another serving of this!  Instead, I tried an Ao Yasai (mixed gourmet greens with ginger) and a sushi roll w/ brown rice, the latter I thought was price-y considering the very small portion given.  I was so unimpressed by its unexciting flavors that I don't even recall what kind of roll I tried!  Pretty sad, I know.  \\n\\nI told myself I wouldn't go back, but I would like to give Hana another try, perhaps for lunch and/or dinner with a group of friends and have apps and wine/sake!\",\n",
       " \"I used to frequent the Lost Leaf almost daily starting the day they opened, unfortunately I cannot say the same anymore. I used to love the refrigerator full of beers, the music, and the cool little home, not to mention the biggest thing, the promise of a full bar. Now, everytime I go there it's full of douchebags, they are out of the beer I want, and the music has somehow become sucky. Perhaps the biggest kicker... there is still no full bar! The servers are surly kids, who have the audacity to tell you were you cannot stand, seemingly forgetting they work in the hospitality industry. If this were a city with a ton of good bars, that would never fly. But since they are one of the only games in the area, most people go back just out of convienence. The last time I was there, we coaxed a bum to dance to 1920's tunes that were being played out of the treehouse out front. That was about the only redeeming quality. And I swear if I see one more dude with girls jeans trying to look cool with a bomber of the worst beer imaginable I'm gonna snap.\\n\\nThanks for ruining what could have been an awesome hang out spot guys.\",\n",

I thought in this \"recession\" that having a restaurant that packed was a pretty amazing thing.  The service was superb.  The food was overall yummy.  I did not enjoy the greasy wonton chips that are served for free before the meal.  My friend really like them though?!?!  The hot tea was good.  My veggie dish (something with bamboo shoots, mushrooms, green pepper, broccoli, ect.) and steamed rice was good.  I ate every single bite.

And because of an event that fell apart this week I had a bug to eat something Asian. So I found it and stopped in.\\n\\nChinese fast food. They also have hamburgers and a few other things. I stuck with something I figured I would like, orange chicken ($7.95). It came reasonably quick, was too hot to eat right away. Most of my Chinese fast food consists of Panda Express and Ming Gee. This was much better, in addition to the onions and bell peppers listed mine had mushrooms, celery, sprouts and some other stuff. Service was on styrofoam with plastic utensils. Even though I was eating in the rice came in a take out box which I thought was sorta weird. I still hate eating out alone but at least I wasn't the only person in the place. Each side of the place had a long upholstered bench with tables and chairs that could be slid along to make up different seating and two tables in the middle.\\n\\nThere was nobody being served at the front counter when I was finished so I stopped,picked up a menu and talked to the woman there and found out she is an owner.

My Kansas City Strip was out of this world and probably the best piece of meat I've had all year. Gorgonzola mac & cheese and sauteed mushrooms were real winners as well. I'm not a dessert person, but the warm butter cake should be illegal it's so good. I was stuffed already when it came to the table, and then I ate all of it. \\n\\nThe only hiccup all night was our seafood tower was short a shrimp, and when I told the waiter don't worry about it he said ok, and then proceeded to bring us a fourth shrimp on it's own bed of ice.

The students there were very unprofessional. They talked about their personal lives, talked to each other, and just were generally inappropriate for a business setting. Their supervisor overheard everything and did not say anything. This is pretty disturbing since some of these girls stated that they were going to work at places like Dolce in a few weeks. \\n2. The gel manicure was billed as 'unchippable' by the people at this salon, but my friend had one whole nail peel off the day after the manicure and my nails chipped 2 days after. This is especially annoying because it is difficult to remove the polish that remained on my nails, so they just look bad. \\n3. The massage was pretty weak. \\n4. They don't have enough carts for pedicures, so I had to put my foot up on my 'pedicurist's' lap...that's a bit odd. \\n5. It was difficult to make an appointment here.

The DJ is either hit or miss; sometimes he plays awesome music and everyone's on the dance floor and other times the dance floor is completely empty because the music ain't so great. \\nI've always wondered if anyone has become so intoxicated while at Sandbar that they have fallen into the little pond outside. Unfortunately, I have never seen this happen.\\nBut I have woken up in the morning with a Sandbar server schedule in my pocket with no recollection as to why.\\nMy friend was dancing so crazy one night on one of the platforms, that when she jumped off, she sprained her ankle. \\nSee? Sandbar's a really good time.\\nOh and if you get hungry, there's a little hot dog cart out front, so you can eat a wiener, drink and be merry.\",\n",

While this may be a hot-spot for hotel guests, I think that locals might be missing out on its charm. \\n\\nI am a huge fan of anything the Camelback Inn does, especially since they offer live music and a great space for relaxation and Rita's Kitchen is no exception. This restaurant is airy and opens up to the spacious Camelback Inn patio where they play live music every night. \\n\\nBreakfast: \\n\\nBreakfast at Rita's is sublime and pretty reasonably priced. They offer a breakfast buffet for around $23 which includes eggs made to order (including omelets), pancakes, waffles, pastries, fresh fruit, bacon, sausage and hashbrowns. It's a great pick for a leisurely weekend breakfast. Just today was Mother's Day and while we only did the breakfast buffet, I did catch a glimpse of the Mother's Day brunch and holy moly do they know how to wow a crowd! Not only did they have stations set up all throughout the restaurant, patio and R-Bar, but they also had an extensive dessert area with build-your-own sundaes, freshly made cotton candy (in an old fashioned cotton candy maker) and a long dessert table with a chocolate fountain. \\n\\nLunch:\\n\\nLunch here is sublime and I also enjoy either the tacos or the chicken sandwich. The chicken sandwich is particularly a favorite of mine due to the cheese and sauce. The fries are tasty as well and you can either get sweet potato or regular. I also get sweet potato then regret not just getting the regular which are better in my mind.

But, I've gone in a handful of times and even bought a dress or two on sale at Neiman's in the past.  I admit, the quality associated with the designer labels at this store is pretty amazing.\\n\\nAnyways, I felt some major pressure to register at Neiman's from my mom, so I met my mother-in-law-to-be at this Neiman's location on Sunday.

       " \"I used to live off this place. They cut their meats and cheeses fresh like a real deli, so already it kicks the shit out of Subway, Quiznos, and every other fast food deli chain that offers up pre-packaged meats. Their bread and cookies are fresh as well. For some reason, this location has better tasting food than any other Port-o-Subs I've been to. Don't know why.\\n\\nThere's always a long line at lunch, but it moves fast. There's some good people watching to be done here - cops eat here, firemen eat here, doctors and nurses eat here, and you also get the entire spectrum of downtown Scottsdale folk... sometimes you would think you arrived at a costume party or they are filming a new Village People video. I don't know what it is and I don't know that it matters either, but good looking people eat here. Whatever you want to make of that... \\n\\nMost of the people that work here are really nice and competent. They keep this place pretty clean as well. Once I noticed some fruit flies buzzing around by the soda machine and was told they sometimes come with the fresh fruit they get for the smoothies (which are fantastic). Outside of that, I can't complain about this sub shop and I eat here all the time... it's almost just about as good as a non-chain place.\",\n",
       " \"A perfectly good place for a chill Friday night dinner. I absolutely loved the atmosphere. Matta's has an upper level where every table is set up like a balcony over looking the main level, it feels like your in a courtyard. The only thing it's missing is an open look at the sky. There was also a mariachi band playing during the night which added to the appeal. And to make things really cool (at least to me), they did a Mexican version of the Godfather theme song. Loved it! \\n\\nThe chips and salsa came out right away. The hot had a kick to it, but wasn't very flavorful. The mild was excellent, but I prefer my Salsa hot. I tried combining the two, which was only okay. The menu isn't really anything special. It's a lot smaller than most Mexican restaurants, and is loaded with the standards. My girlfriend had a chicken burrito which she enjoyed. I had the chicken fajitas, which were good as well. The food was good, but not great enough to make me run back out. \\n\\nThe service was excellent. Our waitress was on top of everything despite the fact that we were on the upper level. We watched and felt a little bad as she had to run up and down the stairs (she usually took the stairs that weren't as visible, but you know what's going on) to get everything for us. I could imagine that if a server were having a bad enough day, they would just make people up there and wait. \\n\\nWe just randomly chose Matta's because we happened to be at Mesa Riverview. I enjoyed my experience there. While it's not a place that I'm dieing to try again, if someone suggests Mexican, and we're nearby, I'd recommend it.\",\n",
       " 'Piestewa and Camelback Peaks are the two boobs of Phoenix. They\\'re real, and they\\'re spectacular. \\n\\nOf course, being all-natural one is just a slight bit larger than the other, but this is barely noticeable. Camelback is barely 100 feet higher than Piestewa, whose nipple... er... summit, is at 2608 feet. Climb either one and you can enjoy great views of the other at various vantage points, not to mention views of the city. \\n\\nAlthough Camelback strikes me as a funner climb, I give Piestewa 5 stars because for what it lacks in the intangible fun factor it makes up with being just a tad less insanely crowded. Piestewa Peak Park also has a number of really cool looking trails that don\\'t go up to the summit, which look to me to be worth exploring some day.\\n\\nSpeaking of female body parts, the former name for this peak was \"Squaw\" Peak. This has inspired one of the most ridiculous controversies in modern times in our state. Native Americans are offended by the term \"Squaw\", and regardless of the linguistic origins of the word, it is basically the equivalent of terms such as \"Negress\" or \"Jewess\". In the 1990s, the State of Arizona proposed ending the controversy by renaming the peak after our greatest political leader ever and the father of American conservatism, Barry Goldwater. The whining dipshits who apparently constitute our voting population rejected the idea. They\\'d rather continue using a stupid name that has no historical or sentimental value whatsoever just to spite Native Americans, rather than honoring one of their finest citizens.\\n\\nAnd so, in this decade, Democratic Governor Janet Napolitano put an abrupt end to the whole issue. She gave the sqaw-apologists the finger and ordered the renaming of the peak to Piestewa, after Lori Piestewa, the first US woman soldier to be killed in the 2003 Iraq war and a member of the uniquely-Arizonan Hopi Nation. A fitting end to the debate.\\n\\nNOTE: Even more fitting, the original name of this peak was Squaw Tit Peak, and I swear to God I\\'m not making that up to be funny.',\n",
       " 'FINALMENTE!!!\\n\\nAndiamo....\\n\\nFOOD\\n--------\\nAppetizer: Fritto Misto, which is a trio of fried appetizers. For the day, ours included a cheese, a stuffed olive, and whole leaves of broccolini. The cheese wedge was great (I wish I remembered what it was), and have you ever had a deep fried veal-stuffed olive? Very interesting. The flash-fried broccolini took a little getting used to, since the leaves kept crumbling as I was trying to eat them, but still tasty, if subtle.\\n\\nMain: Orecchiette alla Puttanesca. Man. This is the real deal. Orecchiette is the \"little ear\" pasta and \"alla puttanesca\" means it\\'s made \"whore style\". \\n\\nAnd what a beautiful, classy, yet very vibrant whore she is.\\n\\nThe pasta was cooked just perfectly, and even though puttanesca sauce usually goes with a stringier pasta (spaghetti, linguini, etc.) it worked really well with the orecchiette. \\n\\nAnd the sauce. Holy mother, this streetwalkin\\' hussy of a sauce with its 12 ingredients: capers, breadcrumbs, anchovy sauce, garlic, olives, basil, olive oil, and, uh, the other 5. The flavors were a perfect, clear-heeled harmony. Nothing overpowered the other. Subtle and humble home food. It really tasted just like something my Italian friends\\' mothers would cook in their kitchen.\\n\\nAs for the servings, when I first got my bowl I was thinking, \"oh ok, this is a European serving. I\\'m still going to be starving after this.\" And, um, nope. Why? Because I slowed down. I savored my meal, and took my time with the dish. And by the end, was I hungry? Not at all. I really enjoyed this meal. And the serving was just right. Complimentary packs of long breadsticks are also found on each table. \\n\\nSERVICE\\n-------------\\nVery friendly, efficient, and willing to go through the menu in detail and answer any more questions about the restaurant. Dishes were brought out in a timely manner and there was never any rush after the meal was completed to clear the table. \\n\\nAnd the mood inside Pastabar was palpable. Everyone looked happy, excited, and relieved that the restaurant was finally open for business. And I felt the same for them. \\n\\nSETTING\\n-------------\\nI would say the space was just the right size. Not a cavernous place in the least. Probably the same size as Sens, maybe  even a little smaller. It\\'s tucked away in the very back of the hallway of the building, so much so that I completely missed it when I was IN THE HALLWAY the previous afternoon looking for it. But I like it a little hidden off, actually. \\n\\nThe colors inside are warm, with a modern bistro feel. No windows looking outside but I didn\\'t mind that. There is seating at the bar, a few two-tops up front, and larger tables in the back. Selections from different Shins albums made up the soundtrack throughout the dinner, and while the music sounds like it could be incongruous with a bunch of little ears cooked whore-style, it worked. \\n\\nI definitely don\\'t think this is going to be as \"scene-y\" as Sens. It has a completely different vibe. \\n\\nEXTRA CRIB NOTES\\n-----------------------------\\n* the main courses of Pastabar are pasta and ONLY pasta. No veal parm here. And no hoikey sauces like Olive Garden-y alfredo or a jar of sugary Prego.\\n* It\\'s great\\n* Prices for antipasti range from $7-$11-ish and mains $11-ish to $18. I spent around $26 with tax and a nice tip.\\n* it\\'s great\\n* No liquor license (yet). For now, sparkling waters, lemonades, a number of sodas (including root beer & cream soda). \\n* it\\'s great\\n* complimentary valet awaits the diners, if you\\'re averse to parking close by yourself.\\n* it\\'s great\\n* It\\'s open till midnight on weeknights and 2 am on weekends! What more could you ask for?\\n* did I tell you it\\'s great?\\n\\nALL IN ALL\\n---------------\\nAn awesome asset to the area and I\\'m very content. And as much as I loved my whoreish little ears, all the other pastas on the menu sounded incredible and I can\\'t wait to try them all. \\n\\nI\\'m wishing these guys much success and giving them gratitude to finally being open. A few minor kinks to be worked out (and I wasn\\'t as into the appetizer as I was my entree) so it\\'s not totally perfect but they have started out very strong, and it\\'s only Day 2.\\n\\nAnd here I was thinking my days of giving out 5 stars were over (ok, more like 4.55 and rounding up)...',\n",

Now me, I am not an enchilada person however the enchilada de avocado sounded pretty good as it had two of my favorites stuffed in in, avocado and artichoke. I must admit that it was pretty good. I only finished a little bit of it as I had filled up on the warm chips and salsa that was served when we sat down. Yum. \\n\\nSo why only three stars? Well It's actually 3.5 stars as although the food and the company were great, the service was a little off.

However, once I walked in, I realized that any semblance of having an authentic Chinese meal went out the window (no offense, my hungry white friends!). \\n\\nI decided to try it out anyway, was seated by a friendly waiter and ordered the hot & sour soup (they were able to sub in chicken instead of pork - bonus) and the waiter recommended the house chicken to me. I asked for it to be made really spicy, knowing full well it wasn\\'t going to be (no one EVER listens to me when I demand the food be spicy - listen, dammit, I\\'m brown, people). Anyway, that\\'s my issue.\\n\\nThe hot & sour soup arrived, and it was excellent. I was happy. Nothing mars a Chinese meal more than beginning it with a bowl of shiteous soup. Then came the house chicken (with string beans added for $1). Steamed rice costs another extra buck - I get annoyed when Chinese restaurants don\\'t make it complimentary, but again, my issue. Anyway, the chicken was just ok. Nothing amazing and it still ended up feeling pretty heavy. So that dish I\\'m more willing to give it 2.5 stars. \\n\\nSo why did I bump up the star wattage? I guess the service. \\n\\nThe waiter:\\n\\n* noticed I wasn\\'t devouring my dish and offered to switch it for any other dish of my choice, no extra charge. Who does this nowadays - in a Chinese restaurant no less? Extra star.\\n* is from the SF Bay Area like myself, so he gave me the lowdown for good Asian food in Phoenix (for dimsum he recommended Golden Buddha first, Great Wall second, C-Fu third - then for Vietnamese he recommended some place on 19th Ave between Indian School & Camelback.) He agreed that Thai, Korean, and sushi in Phoenix is kind of a letdown compared to California, but almost all the Asian restaurants (he admitted, including China Chili) cater to their core customers, who by sheer demographics are pretty much not Asian. That said, he told me that China Chili is THE place people go to for Chinese food, including Chris Bianco (of Pizzeria Bianco), the mayor, folks from Channel 10 news, the owner of the Diamondbacks, etc. etc. So take that for what you will.\\n* When I asked if this China Chili was affiliated with...\"oh, the one in Fremont? No. But people say that place is good and fancy and has an electric piano.\" Bonus points for knowing that.\\n\\nAnyway, he recommended I come back and get the Mongolian beef next time, which I\\'ll definitely do, plus the hot & sour soup. I didn\\'t mind the big open seating area - many Chinese restaurants in SF are like this, loud and raucous. \\n\\nAll in all, China Chili is a case where service overcame the food (again, how often does that happen?) to come back and give it another shot. \\n\\nAnd there you have it.',\n",

The ambiance is nice and cozy and I think it works well for a romantic dinner or a big group of friends. The staff has always been pleasant and accommodating and that goes a long way for me in Snottsdale. \\n\\nLast night I was wowed by Mabel's. We had a fundraiser for a great friend who has cancer and they not only let us throw it there FOR FREE, but generously offered to donate 20% of the bar tab to the cause. The service was great that night and they earned a fan for life. Thanks Mabel's, for being so cool, you're a breath of fresh air.\",\n",

Our services was sooooooo slllllllow. Like painfully slow. We waited a long time for refills, a long time for our food, a long time for the check to come. It was really annoying. Our waitress was nice, but slow. \\n\\nOnto the food! We got an order of wings and an order of the fried zucchini. The zucchini was really good but holy hell she should have warned us that it had JUST came out of the fryer that may have been heated by lava. I popped one of those bad boys in my mouth and immediately felt the skin on the roof of my mouth start to come off. Once the burning subsided I was good to go. I hear the wings were tasty, They were really big (I just don't eat wings) \\n\\nI ordered the fish and chips. So yummy! Our friend got the grilled chicken sandwich with a side of grilled asparagus. LOVE that they offer grilled veggies as a side! I snuck a couple asparagus and they were tasty. Hubs got the ribs, it was a huge pile of meat on a plate. He loved it! \\n\\nI will for sure go back, the food was really great, I will just know not to expect quick service.\",\n",

       " \"I went here last night with my wife to celebrate our 2 year wedding anniversary.  We purposely arrived early to have a drink at their bar.  There wasn't much of a selection on their happy hour drink menu so we just ordered our go-to drinks.  Champagne for her and a martini for me.  The hostess/waiter/waitress were very friendly and prompt.  When we were ready for dinner we were brought to the main dining area and our bar tab was transferred without trouble.\\n\\nI made a reservation a few weeks prior and made a notation that it was our anniversary.  Upon arrival at our table there was a card saying happy anniversary which was a nice touch.  The table was smack in the middle of the dining room so my wife asked if we could move to another table.  The host was very accommodating and gave us a better table.\\n\\nThe place is pretty sheik to the eye but uncomfortable.  The 2-top tables are small, too close to other people, and I don't want to sound like a 90 year old, but the chairs are ridiculously uncomfortable.  I don't know about you but I like to eat my too expensive meal in utter comfort.  The noise level is also above where it should be but they were playing some pretty solid tunes throughout the night.\\n\\nOur waitress was excellent and knowledgeable but was taking care of way too many tables which made her unable to come around as often as I would have liked.  I especially liked our sommelier who gave us an awesome wine recommendation.  Also, I'm not sure if this is all the time or not, but all bottles under $300 were 1/2 price so we splurged on a more expensive bottle than we would have normally purchased.\\n\\nThe Food:\\n\\n* Fries - they give these to you instead of bread.  They are excellent especially the truffle ones.  My only issue is that you could tell they were sitting out for a half hour before being served to us.  I would have liked them fresh but whatever.\\n* Wedge Salad - just ok.  The blue cheese and bacon were great though.  It just wasn't the typical steak joint wedge I am used to and was looking forward to.\\n* Burrata Cheese - this was very unique to me and pretty good\\n* Truffled Mac n' Cheese - not the best I've ever had but still pretty good.  Not as thick and cheesy as I would have liked and they use weird noodles.\\n* Wagyu Beef Trio - My wife and I shared this.  Perfect amount for the both of us to share.  Each 4oz piece of steak was perfectly cooked, juicy and delicious.  I still can't tell the difference between regular beef and wagyu though.  The sides were also very good.  We especially liked the mushrooms.  The mashed potatoes were too creamy and just eh.\\n* Beignets - we shared these for desert and they are fluffy, sugary awesomeness.  The sauces are equally awesome.\\n\\nAll-in-all it was a fantastic meal and great experience.  Good food, good wine, good company.  I would come back any time to enjoy a steak or one of their burgers.\",\n",

It was under $9 and I was surprised at the size of it! I attempted but could not finish it. The big pancake was left uneaten. They do have a smaller option for around $6 and that might be the better way to go unless you have just returned from a month long trip through the jungle or plan to share with someone. \\n\\nThe server continued to check on me and even offered up a to go cup of coffee.

I really wished they would have paired some other fruit or spice to add more contrast to the dish. \\n\\nFor my main I got the jerk chicken and I was a little disappointed.

       " 'I can now thank the Humane Society for not only giving me my dog Brutus when I was a child, but now my dog Harley as an adult. A couple of years ago, I planned a visit to the Arizona Humane Society to present them with a corporate donation on behalf of my old company. When I scheduled the meeting, they offered to give me a tour of the vicinity and as a friend of the helpless animals, I said of course and planned my visit. However, I knew that with a tour, I might be in some trouble in the willpower department. \\n\\nWhen I arrived to the center, I was greeted by a pretty view of South Mountain and a wide open vicinity. I walked inside and immediately noted how clean it was for being home to many a furry creature. The staff was warm and welcoming as potential new \"parents\" waited in the lobby to adopt a new friend. Kittens and bunnies greeted the guests and there was a special area for the cats being featured that week. The vicinity was a five star facility to say the least and I could immediately tell that the animals were treated well here and in good hands until they found a new home. \\n\\nTo make a long story shorter, they gave us a detailed tour of the complex. I walked through spacious room after spacious room full of dogs of all kinds just wanting a home. As I walked up to one of the cages, a furry ball of fluff looked up at me and placed his paw on the cage. I fell in love immediately. To make matters worse, the staff then took us into a room where we could make a kong of peanut butter and treats for our dog of choice. Of course I had to give it to my new found friend. At that point I knew I was in trouble and could very well be leaving with a dog. So to end that part of my story, I did leave with a dog and Harley has been happy in his new home ever sense. \\n\\nWhile I visited the Humane Society, I couldn\\'t get over their quality of service for not only the clients but the animals themselves. They were clean, kept in spacious areas and they even had a huge playground for the animals to play in each and every day. When i found Harley and started to think about taking him home with me, they took me to a private play area where I could get to know Harley a bit more to make sure he was the right dog for me. A staffer stayed in the area and helped me with any questions I had. When I made the decision to take Harley home with me, they neutered him, gave me a couple free vet visits and sent me home with some treats, food and a leash. They even have a pet store to pick up all your essentials for your new friend. And did I mention that the proceeds go back to the Humane Society...a nonprofit? \\n\\nThis Arizona Humane Society is a five star pet resort that focuses on making the most of a pet\\'s stay until they find a new home. I suggest just taking a visit to the facility to see how well-kept it is. They even have horses that they rescued. Sorry folks, they are not up for adoption though. So thank you Arizona Humane Society for bringing my little dog Harley to me and saving so many animals from the streets.',\n",

And a bunch of houses under construction. And look at that sky. Wowza. \\n\\nOk, so stopping to enjoy the view is one thing. Stopping to figure out where the hell you are is another. \"Don\\'t worry,\" I told my friend. \"This city is laid out in a grid. If anything, we can walk down the other side of the mountain and cut back across on the street.\" Oh, little did I know. \\n\\nLet me give you the back story. I\\'ve been to South Mountain twice. The first time was Christmas Eve 2006 when hardly a soul could be found. I met a friend there and we blazed our own trail. He always had his jeep in sight, so no harm in getting turned around. I trusted him to be my guide. \\n\\nThe second and last time I hiked South Mountain was in February. My best friend flew in to Phoenix for the weekend (for my birthday) and since the weather was so great (in comparison to Detroit), she wanted to be out in the sun as much as possible. No problem. I knew where we could go for a good hike. Little did I know we\\'d get lost. \\n\\nWe parked at the 24th St. entrance and picked our path, the Mormon Trail. We were on our way to discovering religion, we joked, passing by several other hikers. When we reached a recognizable summit, we stopped to appreciate the view... and then ponder our location. Should we turn around and go back the way we came? Were we still on the Mormon Trail? Where were the markers, the loops, the signs from God? We looked at each other, each of us having a take-no-prisoners personality when it comes to conquering great piles of rock. \"Onward!\" we shouted, punching the air with our fists. \\n\\nA little while later, we were once again stopped, our eye squinting against the retiring sun. I wouldn\\'t call us \"lost,\" as this point in time, but that\\'s only because I\\'m too stubborn to admit such an error. \"Let\\'s ask somebody,\" I suggested. So, the next hiker dude that passed by, we stopped to ask him, \"Will this trail loop back around?\" \"Where do you want to go?\" he asked. That\\'s when I realized we had tied our tennis shoes tight only to march into a rocky labyrinth. I told him where we parked and he said it was a good 2 hour hike back to our car, yet about another mile or two to the 48th St. entrance. Oh, no problem, I thought, since the city was laid out like a grid. Little did I know there are exceptions to that. \\n\\nWe pressed on, thanking our impromptu guide friend. We hiked and hiked and hiked, passing by fellow hikers and mountain bikers. Finally, the trail opened up to flat land. We were close, or so we thought. When we reached the end of the trail, there was no parking lot and no street connecting us to where we needed to go. Instead, there was a long gravel road that weaved itself through a golf course. W.T.F.\\n\\nWe set out to walk the long gravel road until we hit Baseline, in which we were determined to cut back Westward and find my car, the only way we had of getting anywhere. The sun was setting. We had no time to waste. \\n\\nHaving hiked about 15 miles already, our feet were heavy, like cinder blocks. But, we continued on. \"Let\\'s hitch a ride,\" I suggested. People were gathering in their wonderful Ford pick-up trucks and jeeps. Hikers are friendly, I thought; somebody was bound to accept our plea for help. We opted to just do this ourselves. \\n\\nThat\\'s when a car slowed down. \"Ugh, creep,\" I thought. Instead, it was our helpful hiker friend from the summit. He asked if we needed a ride. My best friend and I exchanged glances. I thought, \"We can take him.\" After a 70-second long pause, we accepted. She hopped in back and I rode shot gun, leaving my seat-belt off and the door unlocked, in case of a speedy getaway. \\n\\nWe chit chatted on the drive down the road, which lead to another road, and then another and another, until we finally touched Baseline. Where the hell were we? That\\'s when it hit us. We would have been walking another 7 miles on foot back to my car. All these windy, disjointed roads. Damn golf course. Damn South Mountain. Damn unmarked trails. It should change its name to the Moron Trail, for we just blazed it enthusiastically. \\n\\nThe kind hiker man dropped us off at my car and drove away. With a sigh large enough to blanket the skyline, we unlocked my car, got inside and drove away - away from South Mountain, nature\\'s beast and practical joker. \\n\\nWe counted the miles and the minutes it would have taken us to get back to my car. Another hour, at least. The sun would have set by then and we would have missed our dinner engagement. Lucky for us, we stopped the right hiker friend at the right moment; otherwise, I may never have made it home to write this review.',\n",

Very easy to miss and it blends in with everything else.  No personality.  I guess when you are so famous though, you don\\'t need \"personality\" to get people in.  Second of all, I hate Scottsdale.  Again, I can\\'t subtract stars for this, it doesn\\'t make sense.\\n\\nAs for the cupcakes, they are really only okay.  I will set aside my disdain for chains and judge solely on the quality of the cupcakes.  I ordered a red velvet and a peanut butter chocolate.  The red velvet was very plain.  It lacked the subtle cocoa flavor and the lovely tangy flavor of the buttermilk that should be peeking through the copious amounts of red food coloring.  It wasn\\'t.  I just tasted red and cake.  Not really that great.  To top it all off, my cupcake crown popped off the second I picked it up.  This pissed me off.  It essentially ruined my first bite.  At least I could still eat it.  The cream cheese frosting was so-so.  I really like a big bold cream cheese flavor to pair with a red velvet, and this was barely tangy.  It was super sweet, slightly grainy and it got that crust on the top from sitting out too long.  The red velvet overall was kind of meh.\\n\\nThe peanut butter chocolate was definitely not what I had hoped for.  The cake was very dense and peanut buttery, but lacking in sugar.  It was studded throughout with chocolate chips.  The frosting was chocolate, and it\\'s texture was nice and smooth.  It was covered in chocolate jimmies, I just love those.  This cupcake was okay.  The lack of sweetness in the cake made me wished it was saltier.  A saltier cake paired with the delightfully sweet frosting would have made for a much more grown-up and sophisticated cupcake.  It was just okay as is.\\n\\nSprinkles, I will not be back.  I don\\'t like you.  Good luck in all you do though.  I would never wish bad things on a cupcake bakery.',\n",

I don\\'t know who they have cooking here, but with all the great stuff they have next door it should be A LOT better. \\nThe salsa should have been the first clue...it was just ok.  Again, knowing what they make in house next door, made this salsa pretty sad.  Wanting an Agua Fresca to drink and again knowing next door had like 7+ varieties, I was disappointed they only had horchata and pina here. I got the pina, which was probably the best part of this meal. \\nI was really craving some tacos, and noticed they only really offered them under the appetizer menu as street tacos. Also wanting to have a sopito, I thought WTH I will get the sampler platter and add a taco. \\n\\nThe platter came with 2 mini chimis, 2 mini taquitos, 2 mini cheese enchiladas and a soptio each of chicken and beef. All looked good when it came out. I enjoyed the taco first...the last thing I was to enjoy on this culinary outing. Then, digging into the chicken enchiladas, the sauce was a \"mole\". This was not a good mole...way too sweet, someones idea of a mole. Yes, just because a mole has chocolate doesn\\'t mean it\\'s a chocolate sauce.  And the chicken, stringy bland kinda tough. Everything followed suit, bland not very authentic, someones idea of mexican food. It all reminded me of something I would get if in the Mid-west somewhere and wanted Mexican food...not Arizona! \\n\\nThe only saving grace to this meal was that it was happy hour on a Saturday and the platter was 1/2 off and the taco was a buck so I left paying only $9 instead of $15. \\n\\nWhile I will continue to eat at the Market....I will pass on TRADICIONES...*blegh*.',\n",

The chicken was nicely presented, and was fairly tender and juicy.  Of the three different toppings (Balsamic and tomato, mushroom cheese, and mango salsa), my least favorite was the mango salsa since the mango in it, while fresh, wasn't totally ripe.  The creole fish was presented in a Spartan way, with just one piece of fish with a mound of side next to it on a plain white plate.  The fish (Some type of white fish, maybe carp?) was a freshwater white-flesh fish and had a decent seasoning and was cooked well. \\n\\nService was friendly, but we did not have any silverware on our table when we were seated and had to ask for it after our entrees were served to us.

If you get lobster or crab from them, the waitress will crack and de-shell it for you; it's such a great service since a lot of the time I am hesitant to get any kind of crustacean because I don't like getting messy and spending all that time getting the meat out of the shell.  The lobster here, while technically from Maine, is flown in fresh from Boston, and they offer 1.25 lb, 3 lb, and occasionally a showcase jumbo lobster.  When I went here they were touting an 8 lb lobster for those with the stomach (and coin) to spend a pretty penny on the Yao Ming of lobsters.\\n\\nWhile the sides are very basic, the seafood is understandably the real star of the show.  While I was happy with my fresh lobster, I did try some salmon wellington, which was some of the best tasting salmon I've had in some time.  It was very tender and moist, and very fresh.  I'm also happy to report that they have soft shell crabs here this season, which is one of my favorite seafood items.\\n\\nThe ambiance itself, for me at least, is a bit lacking.  They don't call it the Salt Cellar for nothing, for when you descend into the restaurant through a flight of stairs, it's very dark and a bit damp and chilly.

While the decor may be a bit \"weird\" and \"puzzling,\" make no bones about it, the beer selection is great.\\n\\nLet\\'s re-cap 2 of my experiences, shall we?\\n\\nDINNER:\\n\\nArrived shortly after 6 p.m. on a Saturday and sat in the bar area, which was littered with a few patrons. Live music started at 7 p.m. Since Saturday is considered \"All Day Happy Hour,\" I went with a $5 sandwich - turkey, with smoked provolone. On the side, fresh fruit. They call this their \"Half and Half.\" The sandwich was okay. Nothing I can\\'t make at my own hacienda, though. I really liked the turkey, which like appeared freshly carved. The beverage: Sam Adams Summer ale, which was their seasonal at the time. \\n\\nMy family, who dined with me, thought the food was okay. When both my brother and my dad ordered beef, they weren\\'t asked what temperature they wanted it cooked at. They were just given it well done. I would not have stood for that. \\n\\nOverall, the food is average \"bar style\" food. The menu is large, though. It may take you several minutes to narrow down your choices. From calzones and burgers to sammies, you have options. \\n\\nJUST DRINKS:\\n\\nNow we\\'re talking. If you\\'re looking for a low-key place to hang for a couple hours, play some pool, watch some sports or hear live music, I would suggest checking out this place. They have two pools tables: one downstairs in the bar area; one upstairs. They also have a video game machine at the bar. (Beware that the pool tables were probably bequeathed to this place. After all, balls disappear. Where did the que ball go? Hmm.)\\n\\nAs for the beer, well... Let\\'s just say they have quite the selection. You may not find your fancy imports here, but you will find some really great beers from some Oregon and Colorado microbrews. For that, this place goes up in rating for me (hence the 4 stars). After all, there\\'s not may low-key places \\'round town - especially close to home - that offer quite the array of beers to satiate my discerning tastes. I recommend you try The Great Divide Raspberry Ale, which is made with real raspberries. It\\'s not overly sweet, but it\\'s unique enough that you may find yourself, like me, craving it from time to time. Or, if you enjoy Rogue beer, they do sell the Dead Guy Ale on tap! \\n\\nSure, I list out their beers here, but that\\'ll take up my entire character limit. Let\\'s just say that on their drink menu, THREE WHOLE PAGES are devoted to beer - what you\\'ll find both on tap and by the bottle. \\n\\nSO WHY GO? \\nUhm, that\\'s easy. Go for the great beer. (That\\'s the main reason for the 4-star rating.)\\n\\nIf you love good beer, like I do, and want to chill with some friends, while playing pool or listening to some live jams (though the live music stopped at 9 when i went), then check out Boulders on Broadway. You may even find yourself thinking you stumbled through an invisible portal into a 1970\\'s Denver ski lodge. Good times!',\n",

       " \"Tried the Restaurant Week special, and chose the Stetson chopped salad, mixed mushrooms with polenta, and bread pudding.  The Stetson chopped was amazing.  The preparation is beautiful when they bring it out, and then the taste is the perfect mix of sweet, savory, crunchy, soft once the salad is mixed up.  I tried some of the testosterone salad, which was decent, and filled with a lot of well prepared beef, but it didn't quite compare to the chopped salad.  \\n\\nJust as a general side note, if you choose the restaurant week menu and have the chopped salad and then the mushrooms, I think the flavor of the chopped salad is more bold than the mushrooms, so the mushrooms will taste bland to you.  This happened to me as I transitioned from the salad to main dish, but when I took the mushrooms home in a to go box and ate them later, the more delicate flavor showed through and I appreciated it a lot more.  \\n\\nThe bread pudding was amazing.  Perfectly moist, with lots of flavor, and not too sweet.  \\n\\nService was excellent (Thanks Owen!), and along with the extensive selection of wines, they also have some more unique beers such as lambic, as well as a nice selection of non alcoholic sodas (The cream soda is locally made and very tasty!)\",\n",

       " \"I was inspired to visit Casella's after a coworker told me about their authentically Italian goodness. As my tummy growled today, I was in the neighborhood so I knew just where to go. I walked into a simple yet clean deli. Immediately, I was welcomed by the entire staff (I believe they are all related or at least family through friendship). They asked me if it was my first time in and I said yes, so right away they started giving me a history of the shop and the tasty cuisine. Celebrating their 33rd anniversary (congrats!!), I learned that everything is homemade -- from the meatballs to the chicken salad. The owner said he goes through 40 lbs of chicken a week. He gave me a sample and the chicken was chunky and delicious. I'm not surprised he has to prepare so much chicken every week! The meatballs and freshly cut meat for Philly Cheese-steak sandwiches looked great too! The owner mentioned he is from Philly so better be ready for some authentic Philly and Italian style cookin'! \\n\\nWhile I was there, the owner was slicing some fresh provolone, so I added that to the warmed turkey sandwich I ordered. The turkey was tasty, the provolone was yummy and the sourdough roll tasted like it was fresh from the oven. It was $8 for a sandwich and soda but the sandwich was hefty enough that I saved half for later. As I walked out, everyone said goodbye to me and I felt like I was leaving a family dinner. \\n\\nIn summary, here's what made Casella's stand out: \\n\\n- The very friendly staff\\n- It's a local family-owned neighborhood deli celebrating their 33rd anniversary. Gotta support the local businesses! \\n- Clean decor \\n- Tasty, homemade food that's on display for visitors to see \\n- A good family-style atmosphere that greets you the second you walk inside. \\n\\nI'm not sure how it's taken my so long to find this local treat, but now that I've found it, I plan on becoming a regular. \\n\\nDirections: Note that this is hidden in the Basha's strip mall (on the side of Granite Reef) but don't let that fool you!\",\n",

We had Chicken Satay and Angel Wings.  The Satay was the least interesting item we had, it was merely good.

       " 'I went to Saba\\'s feeling a little scared.  Fast food Greek in a strip mall?  This could go one of two ways...surprisingly good or health code violation bad.  \\n\\nI am very glad to say it didn\\'t end being the latter.  In fact, the food here was pretty damn good.  I did expect Saba\\'s to be an order at the counter joint, so I was a little disappointed to see it was actually a tiny restaurant.  I like my Greek fast and cheap, okay?  But I got over it, got a table and began the interminable wait for our server to stop chatting with other diners and take our order.\\n\\nThe menu has all the normal Greek items, including falafel- little fried balls of joy I might add- gyros, vegetarian platters, spanakopita and dolmas.  Prices for the sandwiches and gyros are pretty cheap, but when you venture into the platter territory, you\\'re going to pay for it. Platters start around $10 and go up.  I ordered the falafel, of course, and so did my boyfriend.  The pita sandwiches don\\'t come with any sides, so we ordered a basket of fries to go along with our meal.\\n\\nThe dcor was pretty cool with big pictures of Greece all over the walls and the classic Greek music piped in.  Unfortunately, not even the Greek music could mask the hideous, loud tool of a diner that was sitting at the table in front of me. He was one of those idiots that has to talk so loud, even the half-deaf cook in the kitchen can hear him.  He was so loud I felt like I should respond to his questions.  Hey moron- saying things like \"I like it loose, like my women,\" is just not funny.\\n\\nAnyways, when we finally got our food, it was really good.  The falafel pita and the fries were tasty, but our server sucked.  He obviously knew the loud tool, and kept chatting with him while we waited for our check.

       " \"There's not much more I can say about Rula that hasn't already been said. Except, I guess, I can tell you why I like this place. I like it for two glorious words: HAPPY + HOUR. \\n\\nYes, those two words matters so much to me. Rula offers 1/2 off all appetizers and discounts on pints. What could be better? I say try the brie, for it comes with an unbelievable apple chutney. If you're looking to split an entree with a friend, opt for the lamb stew - served with a side of soda bread. The stew is hearty and the serving is huge. I've also had the shepherd's pie, which was pretty tasty. Way too large for one person, though. \\n\\nAlso, I discovered that Rula can make ya a Raspberry or Chocolate Guinness. I don't know how either tastes, for I went with a plain (but satisfying) pint. I asked to sample the concoctions, but was told Rula doesn't let people sample liquors. Fair enough. \\n\\nIf I could change one thing about this place (ok, maybe more than one thing), I'd have a larger beer selection - even sold by the bottle. I'd also make it less noisy and crowded at night. If you don't get there early enough to stake your spot, you're likely to be standing the entire time. That doesn't make for a very comfortable experience. Word to wise: take advantage of Rula's casual atmosphere and leave your ridiculously high heels at home.\\n\\nIt's great that Rula offers live music. I wish they offered more. Sure, the outside patio is great, but what if I'm in the mood to play darts? I guess I'll have to go to another bar for that... and for the beer I'm really craving.\\n\\nWORD TO NON-MEAT EATERS:\\nTry their veggie burger thingy - with mushrooms, peppers and such all heaped between two soft and delicious pieces of bun. Yum. It comes served with fresh, crispy and DIVINE 'tator wedges. These ain't your normal french fries, people. I STILL have cravings for them!\\n\\nRula Bula's food deserves 5 stars!\",\n",

I think its because I went to the one in Ahwatukee a long time ago and didn\\'t care for the food.  But I don\\'t think they have the same owners since the websites are totally different.  But anyway, on to the review.\\n\\nWe ordered takeout and I was very impressed with how nicely it was all packaged and how quickly it was ready.  Also, the woman on the phone was very friendly, easy to understand in spite of an accent, and patient in explaining the menu items that I was unfamiliar with. All the appetizers sounded so good, we decided to get a bunch so the hubby and I could just pick at them since he was sick and didn\\'t have much of an appetite.  However, the portions were bigger than expected so we ended up with quite a lot of food.  Lettuce wraps were very tasty, I loved the dressing on them.  Eggrolls were good but a little too much \"wrapper\" and not enough filling IMO.  Sweet potato chips were not what I was expecting, they were the white sweet potatoes that really don\\'t have much taste to them and they were deep fried with I believe a panko breading on them.  A little bland but the sweet/hot dipping sauce they came with was fantastic.  I loved it so much I would order this again just for the sauce.  Also got some chicken soup for the sick hubby which I didn\\'t try but he said was quite good. I threw in some pad thai noodles since that basic dish is always my test when evaluating a new Thai restaurant.  I asked for a four (out of five) on the spiciness scale and that was perfect for me.  I was very pleased at the heat level and overall flavor of the dish.  So many places hold back on the chiles if you are American, even if I insist I want it hot, and I have never understood why. The only thing missing was a squeeze of lime and garnish of fresh cilantro that I like on my pad thai.  Presumably you could get that upon request if you were dining in, it was no big deal to me since I had some at home.\\n\\nI still prefer Yupha\\'s as the best Thai in the area.  But I will definitely be back here for takeout because of the friendly, speedy service and convenient location.

While he was completely engaged in talking to our group, I could tell he was also constantly surveying the restaurant to make sure all was running smoothly.  Every patron that walked in the door received immediate attention including our group.  Our waitress was sweet and I liked that she gave some attitude back to Jared when he was joking around with her.\\n\\nWe had a blast on top of a great meal and ended up staying for hours enjoying  two bottles of wine (maybe more than that as I lost track) during that time.  One of them was a La Crema Pinot Noir, but I think we had a merlot as well and maybe another Italian Red.  I guess I'll have to go back and take notes next time.  Another reason to return will be to try the brusschetta - it sounds amazing.  \\n\\nI have a feeling it won't take me as long to return to La Bocca as it took for me to get there in the first place.

       " 'Imagine this, a swanky new Scottsdale restaurant that has down to earth prices, fantastic food and attentive top-notch service? Sometimes it\\'s hard to believe that this kind of place even exists, but its no mirage, the Spotted Donkey Cantina is everything that I had hoped and more. \\n\\nStarting with the service, there are details that just go to show how the owners and management are in tune with training of the staff. Everyone we encountered was pleasant, seemingly happy and genuine. \\n\\nI have to tell you though, when it comes to eating at SDC, you\\'ll be in good hands, Chef Patrick Bolls hands to be exact. His background includes years working with local chef-lebrity Robert McGrath, which has paid off in chiles. The southwestern influenced menu is well balanced with just a little bit of something for everyone. I mean who doesn\\'t love the addictive crunch of La Canasta Corn Chips ($6)? Along side are 3 different salsas including a smoky charred tomato, a deeply flavored red chile orange and finally a tomatillo green chile salsa. All were surprisingly mild though these seemed more about flavor rather than scorching your face, that\\'ll come later.\\n\\nThe \"Shooters\" ($8) seemed harmless enough. A chubby jalapeno pepper stuffed with cheddar cheese and bacon then encrusted with a coating of tortillas and deep fried. At fist bite your mouth is filled with a creamy spurt of hot cheese followed by the pork-tastic flavor of bacon. Then it hits you, the burn from the jalapeno is scorching but a quick dip into cilantro buttermilk sauce helped cool the flame. \\n\\nIf you\\'re still trying to cool the flavor induced fire one of SDC many salad choices will do the trick. The Spotted Donkey \"Chop\" Salad ($12) is prepared table side with you controlling the amounts of roasted corn, cucumber, queso fresco, cilantro, warm smoked bacon, and avocado. Then tossed in a luscious jalapeno buttermilk dressing and served with crispy flour tortilla chips on the side, it cools and satisfies. Composed into tidy rows of tortilla crusted chicken breast, avocado, bacon, chopped egg and manchego cheese and dressed in chipotle vinaigrette, the dinner sized Southwest Chicken Cobb Salad ($12.50) was almost big enough to share. \\n\\nThe center of my universe, at least for a minute, was the char grilled Big Ol\\' Jack Ass Angus Burger ($11.50). This is a seriously tasty burger, topped with cheddar cheese, caramelized onions, avocado, jalapenos and horseradish mustard, fries on the side. Continuing with the meat parade, a sizzling iron skillet filled with Fajitas ($16) was placed in front of me. While you have your choice of chicken or shrimp, the idea of beef tenderloin mixed with sausage, sweet onions and tomatoes seemed like the hearty choice. Along side are the usual accompaniments like guacamole, salsa, crema and warm flour tortillas, what was unusual were how quickly I scarfed these down, delicious. \\n\\nWhile the space feels decidedly modern and upscale there wasn\\'t one moment where I felt uncomfortable or out of place, even with burger juices running down my face.',\n",

I only needed one proof of residence, although I brought the recommended three, including a Netflix envelope. \\n\\nOnce I had my card, I was ready to explore. I headed first to the public computers that help you locate books... yes! With scraps of papers and mini-pencils handy, I was good to go, once I had selected a couple books to hunt down. \\n\\nSo far, so good.\\n\\nBut then the library got tricky. Running out of the alphabet before I had found my book. Turning into another section - from Fiction to Large Print. WTF? I decided to turn this hunt into more of a tour, so I wandered the aisles, studied the names of sections and eventually re-acquainted myself with the library system. \\n\\nDon\\'t get me wrong. This isn\\'t rocket science. It\\'s also not pop rocks. \\n\\nHaving found my books and a couple DVDs, I proceeded to check out. Super easy, too. I can renew online?

       " \"Being the B, L, and D (breakfast, lunch and dinner) restaurant of a major valley resort takes allot of versatility. From scrambling eggs to grilling a piece of meat the new Rico's American Grill at the Point Hilton Squaw Peak Resort shows that all this can be done and more on a daily basis. \\n\\nWith two massive patios, a large bar and lounge area coupled with a fantastic selection of locally made beers on tap, just beckons you to try them all out. This is easily done by ordering up a Beer Flight ($7) which gets you 4 5oz glasses of their best brews, though this will be tough to chose, they're all good. Then you can order a capped 64oz growler ($20) to go! A growler is simply a large glass jug filled with your favorite beer, your choice. These are all the rage in other cities so I was excited to see Rico's making this offer. Id fill it with my latest favorite, Left Hand Milk Stout Sweet Stout. Think rich flavors of chocolate and coffee blended with milk sugars to give a sweet and creamy taste. \\n\\nIn the large dining room you'll notice a wood fired oven. Unfortunately Rico's doesn't take full advantage of this, only offering a handful of menu items cooked in it including the BBQ Chicken Flatbread ($12). Covered with pulled chicken, red onions, Rico's BBQ sauce and mozzarella, this paired well with our beers though could have used a bit more salt, easily remedied. Another glimmer of what could be was the Wood Oven Baked Penne ($13). Several large meatballs, roasted tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella and pesto ricotta cheese and al dente pasta made for a hearty satisfying meal. \\n\\nA bit lighter but bold with flavor, the Chopped Salad ($10, add grilled chicken $3) made with grilled corn, black beans, bacon, tomatoes, cucumber, avocado, and BBQ-ranch dressing was shaken, not stirred, literally. The salad is brought out in a large martini shaker, dressing added on the spot then shaken well. Kind of a neat twist on table-side salad service, what's old is new again. \\n\\nThe Wicked Meatloaf ($15) could have used some of Rico's BBQ sauce for a sweet contrast instead of the semi-boring-more-like-brown-gravy cracked pepper demi. The meaty slabs were paired up with roasted garlic mashed potatoes that were well seasoned and comforting.   \\n\\nPerfectly cooked and perfectly tender, the New York Strip Steak ($21) had a warm poblano and bacon relish that I could have eaten by the spoonful. The smoky sweet relish made the need for any sort of steak sauce not necessary. Along side was a heaping helping of green chile mac 'n' cheese, so creamy and so gone, delish. \\n\\nApple Skillet For 2 ($7) takes apple slices simmered in a brown sugar and cinnamon, thanks to the wood-burning oven, then topped with cake crumbles and served with cinnamon vanilla gelato. If the skillet weren't so hot I would have licked it clean. \\n\\nWhile Rico's may not have yet achieved culinary greatness, what you do get is solid Southwestern influenced American grub.\",\n",

       " 'Ok, so I have to share my morning experience. But first I must start off by saying this: I\\'m no moron. Honest. \\n\\nSo, this morning I stopped for gas. My tank was getting dangerously low and there was no way I\\'d make it to work. That\\'s okay, for I allotted time this morning for re-filling my tank. From my casa, I turned East on Indian School, vaguely remembering there\\'s a Quick Trip nearby. Perfect. I had stopped there before. \\n\\nBut it wasn\\'t a Quick Trip I saw at the corner of Central and Indian School. Not wanting to risk running out of gas, I opted to stop here, at this ampm station. \\n\\nI pulled up to the closest gas tank, got out of my car, took off my gas cap and reached for the gas nozzle. Only then I discovered there was no pay-at-the-pump option. The short notice on the pump said to select my grade and start filling. \"Wow,\" I thought, \"It\\'s so odd for a station to trust people - especially in this area - to not drive off without paying.\" \\n\\nSo, I followed the instructions, but nothing happened. I kept hitting the grade button. It kept beeping back at me. Still nothing. To top it off (no pun intended), the nozzle was wrapped in this huge rubber tube thing that compressed when I applied pressure to the handle. I had never seen anything like it. \\n\\nThinking my particular pump was fuct up, I pulled my car up to the next one. That\\'s when I saw it - this strange machine, like an Amtrack ticket dispenser. I approached with curiously. That\\'s when I realized. You swipe your card at this central machine (or deposit cash, if that\\'s your preference) and then go back to your pump. Ah-ha. This is how this station works. So, I did just that. I punched in my gas pump number (4) and went back to my car to re-fill the tank. Already annoyed at this point, I figured I\\'d pump enough gas to get me through the next couple of days. \\n\\nOnly, it wasn\\'t pumping. The long rubber thingy was hindering my ability to hook the nozzle up to my gas tank. UGH. So, that\\'s when I flexed my muscles and applied enough pressure to squeeze out $12 worth of gas. Then I re-hooked the nozzle on its perch and walked back to the strange machine for my receipt - it told me to do so when I swiped my card. Only, no receipt came out. I punched the keypad with defiance and walked off. \\n\\nStupid ampm station. Since when does any gas station benefit from being different? I\\'m so used to pay-at-the-pump; you just swipe your card, select your grade, pump your gas, grab your receipt and go. Quick Trip doesn\\'t torment me like this. There is no rubber nozzle thingy in my way. Grr. Screw this.

       " 'Let me tell you about my first crush in Phoenix. It happened to me when I least expected. I was sitting at my small cubicle during my first job. Birthday cake graced the break room practically everyday but today was different. When I walked inside to sing an out of key version of the birthday song to my coworker, I noticed a masterpiece in front of my eyes. A white cake topped with the freshest of fruit and the creamiest of white chocolate morphed into a piece of artwork. One bite into the white cake filled with fresh strawberries and I was in lust. It later turned into love and I\\'ve been happy every since. \\n\\nI silently thank the coworker who introduced me to Honey Moon Sweets because I can\\'t imagine life without knowing about this sweet Phoenix treat. Over the years, Honey Moon Sweets has been my go-to bakery for a special occasion. I\\'ve purchased the \"basic\" cake for birthday parties. Let me just note here that a basic cake from Honey Moon Sweets is practically a masterpiece in any other bakery\\'s mind. When planning my sister\\'s baby shower, I knew exactly where to go. I wanted the perfect cake and a work of art to grace the baby shower table. And behold the Honey Moon Sweets baby cake. It was three tiers, blue with rattles, pacifier, building blocks, a crib, a teddy bear...you name it filling the top. Some of the pieces were frosting creations and some were real toys. It was almost too gorgeous to eat, but we couldn\\'t resist it so enjoyed every bite. It was just as good as it looked if not better. Honey Moon Sweets does a fabulous job of using the freshest of ingredients and you can tell upon the first bite. The scariest part of this cake adventure was the travel time from the bakery to the Biltmore for the baby shower. One wrong move and the cake would have been toast so be prepared to move lightly with this cake in hand. As you can imagine, cakes from Honey Moon Sweets are not budget-friendly, but for what you get from the cake, it\\'s reasonably priced. Just save your coins for a special occasion because it\\'s worth it. I promise.',\n",

It\\'s also unfair to review this on what it will be - since it isn\\'t that yet. \\n\\nToday, it\\'s a mall I rarely visit. Apart from a few stores I would visit out of convenience or necessity, there\\'s not much to offer compared to what it used to have. The fantastic movie theater, Jutenhoops, Alpine Ski Keller, Bear Cover, and even Ed Debevics are all long gone... oops, there I go bringing up the past.

This is a shame really since it\\'s lacking most of the key elements that made it really special. It\\'s still a beautiful outdoor mall and the architecture alone makes it a unique alternative to the cookie-cutter malls that strategically litter the landscape of America. \\n\\nI\\'m worried about what they\\'ll do to the architecture when they renovate this place someday, but I think the fact that this mall isn\\'t terribly interesting anymore in general means it won\\'t be so terribly missed when they lose that last remaining bit of \"special.\"',\n",
       " \"Let me start by saying I have never had BBQ I didn't like. I've had BBQ I could do without, but never that I didn't like. Went in for lunch today and I was the only customer, so I figured cool I will get good service no matter what. The girl sat me and was very pleasant and indicated my waitress would be right over. About ten minutes later, watching the waitress talk on a personal phone call at the bar the whole time, the girl who sat me came over to take the order. She walked up, didn't say a word, and just stared at me. Ok I can live with that it was only a minor inconviencence. \\n\\nGot the #4 lunch chopped pork sandwich with beans and a lemonade and it came out very quickly. Possibly because the beans were Bush's or the like? They tasted like canned baked beans heated up in a microwave. Not cool. The sandwich was ok at best. Thinking back on Stacy's, Honey Bear's, and other great BBQ spots, this one was not even in the same arena. I'll have to go back though and try a sandwich with the correct sauce on it. There was one sauce on the table which after reading reviews here I had assumed was the BBQ sauce. It looked a little watery but I thought whatever its NC style, and it may have been because it was a bit vinegary. On the way out I noticed every other table had a red sauce labeled BBQ, so I guess they have two different ones. I would have preferred the red one I assume. \\n\\nThere was no atmosphere, the place was run down (doesn't appear to have been remodeled after Shish Kabob House vacated) and was generally a dirty feeling place. Seeing as they didn't have any customers at lunch time, I'm assuming the place is going to lose money today. Don't know about other days, but they better get their act together quick or it is going to fail.\",\n",

The server looked at me like a martian when I asked a question about the salad.   It may have been an off-day...  The food was good.  Inventive salads... it didn't exceed my expectations, though.  Hip mid-century modern decor...  I'm not sure that I would go back on my own nickle.\",\n",

       " \"I went here this morning for breakfast with the BF to use our living social deal. We had been to black bear before about 6 years ago in glendale and then again maybe 4 years ago up in Washington state. The last time we went, we were not terribly thrilled with the place. Anyway, we decided to give them another shot and it was pretty decent. I had the shasta scramble, which has avocado, onion, bell pepper, and spinach. This was good, it was not the most flavorful scramble I have ever had, but the veggies were fresh and I liked that this was an option on their menu because most places only have one veggie scramble and it has tons of veggies thrown in with no reason for those veg to go together...anyway, the breakfast came with a ton of country potatoes which I liked more than the typical hash brown. The BF got the one biscuit and gravy breakfast and he said it was alright, not the best ever, but not bad. I thought breakfast here was better than Denny's or Ihop, but clearly not as good as the Farmhouse or Liberty Market and the like of local breakfast places. The service was also good, but I thought it was so weird because our waitress kept calling us 'kids' and calling me sweetie, princess, and honey. I find this somewhat condescending, not that I think that was her intention, but I think that is unnecessary. I know this is kind of a diner thing, but I have never really cared for us, but maybe that's just me. The waitress was good at her job and attentive though, so that is what's important. Also, the portions are huge and I wish they had more options for half meals because I don't like to waste food, but I know people like the giant portion thing.... I would probably come back here for breakfast again sometime, however, because it is decently priced and has decent flavor.\",\n",

I\\'ll try the zin next time.\\n\\nSince I enjoyed the chile-pistachio bread last week, I asked if I could have the commercially-made burger bun swapped out with the new-recipe chile-pecan bread.  No problem.  Ordered it medium, no pickles.  By the time I had thought to take photos of the burger (I was starving so I dug right in!), the scene was a mess!  From the very first slice, the longhorn cheddar-topped patty crumbled into many pieces- I kept wishing I had a spoon to scoop them up!  No matter, as it was still a wonderful meal- loved the smoked bacon, and the chipotle mayo worked well both as a burger condiment and as a dip for the wonderfully crisp and seasoned fries (see photos).\\n\\nIf only there are more happy hour meal selections (only two, excluding the salads) for me to enjoy.

They had stadium-seating area with a projector screen, an ice cream shake area, boxing ring, and a small gym -- where the heck am I!   \\n\\nWe finally found the restaurant area shortly.  The kitchen is an old school food truck, then again everything about this place is old school; chairs, tables, etc.  I ordered the sliders because it was a recommendation - meatball, chicken sausage, and bbq brisket.  A bottle of coke -- yep it figures.  Meatball sliders were the best of the 3, the sausage was definitely and acquired taste.   My sis, had the eggs and avocado one and it was okay.  \\n\\nI enjoy my visit to the Duce simply because of it's odd ball nature.  It's definitely an experience wortha visit.  -  Enjoy!\",\n",

       " \"So I'm apparently oblivious to the fact that anything with the name Joe is owned by the same person.  Luckily for me, I wasn't stupid enough to order bbq pork again.  Joe's Farm Grill is a pretty cool concept and probably the only decent place to eat on this side of the 202 (since Mobsters INC closed, at least).  There are enough review here that clearly he is doing something right.  Suburbanites love to feel like they don't live in a city and, I'm sure, love the idea of a restaurant with picnic tables and trees.  They must because the place was a freaking day care when we went, with snotty brats running all around and climbing on everything.\\n\\nAnyways, back to the food.  I ordered a BBQ Bacon Burger.  I didn't bother to specify how I wanted it cooked and it was, surprisingly, cooked to a decent medium-well.  I subbed some sweet potato fries with it and they were pretty good.  Little more pepper would have made them great but oh well.  The wife had wanted to sub the veggie fries with hers but they made us order a side of them.  That side was literally 3 pounds of fried veggies and was way too much for any human to consume.  They weren't really my thing but the wife enjoyed.\\n\\nThis place does a lot of things well but they suffer from a lot of the logistical problems that Joe's BBQ does.  The line is better and it keeps people from getting backed up but they seem to run out of menus quickly.  People grab them, carry them in line, and leave them at the window.  As a result, there are no menus left when people walk in.  I refilled the thing twice while I was standing in line.  Also, the condiment/drink counter is outside and all in a row right by the door into the restaurant.  These weird clusters of people trying to get a drink or some sauce develop and creates an obstacle course for people going in and out of the restaurant.  This leads me to my final problem - the indoor pickup window.  While the summer is long and hot (and I'm sure leads to a lot of people usually sitting inside), the day we went had tons of people sitting outside.  When their buzzers went off, they had to go inside to pickup the food.  The single door seemed to be all sorts of hazardous for people going in to get food and people coming out with food.  Finally, and I know this sounds stupid, but the trash can outside has the smallest opening ever.  You cannot actually stick your plastic basket inside the trash can and turn it over to dump your food out.  You have to pick the stuff up out of the basket and throw it away with your hands.  I just finished my meal, cleaned my hands, and now I have to wash them again because I had to handle a greasy, sauce-covered piece of paper to throw it away.\\n\\nI know this sounds nitpicky but it turned what would normally be a 4-star peaceful lunchtime experience into a logistically stressful nightmare for me.  When you make it hard for me to get in and out with my food, it makes me feel like you don't want me there.  I know they are going to read this and I know they are going to dismiss it just like my gripes about Joe's BBQ but do me a favor, when you build your next restaurant, hire someone with a degree in urban planning to help with the layout instead of just cramming things wherever you think they will fit.\",\n",

You wouldn't think this place is a brewery because of its small size but it is.  The inside is very quaint and taverny.  It has a very relaxed vibe going on.\\n\\nI ordered the sampler and all their beers are pretty decent.  I decided on the Amber for my pint, but they were all good so it was a difficult decision.  Not bad for a little local brewery at all.  For a quick bite before we moved on we ordered the calamari and the bratwurst splitter.  The calamari was pretty standard and the aioli had a nice kick to it.  The bratwurst was excellent and unique.  Each was perfect to split among 4 people.  The rest of their menu looked good but is pretty much typical bar food.  Well probably a bit better than average bar food.  Anyway, it is perfect food for the place and looking back we should have probably eaten dinner there instead of only an appetizer.\\n\\nPro Tip:  Cross over to the north side of the street at the light as soon as you exit the light rail station.  Otherwise you will be dodging traffic as you try to cross because the place is located on the other side of the street far from another crosswalk.\\n\\nAnyway, I would like to come back for a few beers and food.

Seeing that the salad bar itself was $8.99, and that for only a dollar more I could get a half dozen of fried shrimp, I figured I might as well!  The shrimp comes with your choice of side: either some incarnation of potato (fries, baked, etc.) or veggie (Such as steamed broccoli).  The shrimp looked just how they did in the '80s, pounded then battered and fried.  They were decent, nothing too special, but not bad.\\n\\nThe salad bar has various salad greens, toppings, and dressings to choose from.  There's also an area with cold shrimp and halved avocados.  I was excited to see that they had such high quality items, but unfortunately the execution was something left to be desired.  The shrimp was deheaded, but whole, so if you wanted de-veined shrimp you had to de-vein them on your own.  The shrimp was also overcooked, and a bit tough as a result.  The avocado was a nice touch, but unfortunately many of them were slightly under ripe, so they tasted a little sponge-like rather than creamy.\\n\\nThe hot foods section along the corner area of the buffet has items such as buffalo wings, meatballs in marinara sauce, and a taco bar.  There are also desserts here, like brownies, bread pudding, and soft serve ice cream with various toppings to choose from.  The taco bar was probably the best part of the hot bar.  There are various outer shells to choose from (Tostada, hard taco shell, soft tortilla, taco salad bowls), 2 meats (Ground beef and carnitas), and veggies (Such as pico de gallo, jalapenos, guacamole, cheese, lettuce).  There's also gooey nacho cheese and refried beans at the counter.  The carnitas was probably the best out of all the taco toppings.  It was slow cooked, and had a rich, deep smoky flavor.  \\n\\nService was good, drinks were refilled and dirty plates were removed as needed.

I used to go to a really good Salvadorian restaurant in Seattle, and was excited to see there was one right near where I live now. So the BF and I got here at around 8 at night on a Sunday and it was actually pretty busy. This place is in a tiny strip mall that does not look like it gets much business, and I would have never seen it from the road, so it must be good to still be in business. So I ordered a pollo pupusa, a carne asada pupusa, and a polla tamale, and the BF ordered two bean and cheese pupusas and a carne asada pupusa and we split the pastelitos con papas y queso. Well, the pastelitos were pretty tasty, like fried mashed potatoes, and they came with a spicier cabbage slaw which I liked a lot better than the regular cabbage slaw for the pupusas. All of the pupusas were really good, my real problem was with the sauce. The red sauce that came with them was just kind of flavorless. The place I used to go to had some really good red and green sauces for the pupusas... it was kind of disappointing. Also, about 5 minutes after we got the pupusas, the waitress came by and said 'oh I forgot to tell you we don't have any tamales.' Well, that kind of sucks, why did it take til we were already in the middle of eating to tell us? Also, it screwed up the amount I was trying to spend (since I had 20$ to spend on the deal chicken) which I guess shows that this place is cheap, which is good, but for this particular trip that wasn't good. So we decided to order a dessert to replace the tamale. We got the empanadas de platano with sweet cream. So this was a big deal for the waitress, she had already totaled out the bill and for some reason it was a huge deal to add a dessert at the end (which I thought was weird, but felt guilty about giving her extra work). Anyway, the empanadas were ok, but I've had better. The sweet cream is in the middle of the plantain and it isn't all that sweet. Oh well, I would definitely come back here for some yummy pupusas and maybe try a different dessert next time, the central american quesadilla looked pretty tasty....\",\n",

It doesn't really make sense to top a pizza in such a way, to me.  I prefer draft beer over bottled beer, and all they offer is bottled.

       " \"I went to Eddie's House last night with the BF and two friends for restaurant week and it was a terrible experience. First of all, I had made a reservation for 7:30 more that a week in advanced and we waited until 7:50 to be seated. This was a bad omen, because, as it turns out, the whole night was made up of waiting. Our waiter (who did not share his name, unfortunately because I would tell anyone to avoid him at all costs) was terrible. TERRIBLE. He came by 4 times before taking our order when we were ready after 5 minutes. Each time was a weird excuse. First time he came by I asked for a restaurant week menu, he said 'a restroom menu?' Why would I say that, then I ordered a glass of moscato and he's like the XXXX (whatever brand it was) and i looked down and it was the ONLY moscato.... I was like ya... WTF? So I screamed what I wanted and he's like oh.... sorry.... I can't hear. Then he said 'Oh hey, I'll be back to explain things.' Explain what? we're clearly ready! 'Oh hey, are you ready to order? Well let me go take the order of that big table back there and I'll be back to take yours' (real quote) WHAT? Seriously? We waited over 40 minutes to order. What's worse, is that we looked over like where the ef is this guy, and he was chatting at the bar!!! What, were we not wearing the right clothes? Were we not hip enough to be served? Or was it that we were ordering off the restaurant week menu, are we not ordering enough to get service? Come on.\\n\\n So he finally took our order, and we each ordered all three courses at once, because who knew when he would decide to come back. We got drinks, everyone got beer, except me who ordered the moscato. This was good, but was served in basically a thimble, it was the smallest glass of wine I have ever seen. Then we waited... and waited... and waited. We ate the whole basket of bread (which was great, but overshadowed by our terrible service). We got our appetizers, we had at least one of each available (a peach soup, a salmon flat bread, and a fetoush salad). The soup was really weird, not bad, just different. The salad was overpoweringly oniony, but still tasted good, although it was supposed to have toasted pita and had one tiny piece... and supposedly the flat bread was good, but I don't like salmon, so I didn't try it. Then the waiter came by and said 'oh we're really busy tonight, that's why it's taking a long time for the food) Notice there was no apology or accommodation of any kind. He also asked if we wanted bread with dinner, we said yes, but no bread ever came... weird. \\n\\nWe waited and waited and finally out food came. I ordered the chili chicken, the two boys ordered the meatloaf, and my other friend ordered the shrimp. I thought the chicken had a good flavor, but was really dry. The meatloaf was fantastic! It was really quite delicious, with onion strings, mushroom jus, and mashed potatoes... yum. Supposedly the shrimp were really spicy, but again, I didn't try it. We ate everything, so again, the food was good, the service was awful. \\n\\nSo then the waiter comes by (about 10-15 min after we had finished) and says, oh do you still want dessert? um.... yes, we ordered it and it comes with our meal.... he says 'oh, cuz I think we just ran out of the pot de creme, but I'll look' Well two people had ordered the pot de creme TWO HOURS AGO!!!! Why weren't they left aside? 'Oh we had 200 more people show up tonight that expected' Well, We had a reservation, so it is not our fault that you cannot staff your restaurant appropriately or turn away customers when you are too busy to handle new diners. It does not make sense. What kind of greedy restaurant is this that they can't refuse a table when people who told them they came to eat there can't even get anything off the dessert menu. It turned out they had one left, then the other person who ordered it said, oh ok, i'll have the peach crisp then....'oh, well we're out of that too cuz like it's made fresh from peaches and we didn't buy enough for all of the extra people....' \\n\\nMaybe if we had been served in a TIMELY manner instead of over two and a half hours, they wouldn't have run out. Oh, and maybe if the jerk who was our server had put aside the desserts for us when we ordered it over TWO HOURS before the time when we actually got dessert, that would have been nice too. The desserts were good, the pot de creme was the best, the rest of us got a 'tiramisu' which tasted like cookie dough ice cream.... not exactly what I want in a tiramisu, but fine, I guess. \\n\\nFinally, we get the check (around 200$, so clearly we didn't spend enough money to warrant any service) and we right out how we want the bill split between the two couples, The waiter comes by, and the BF starts saying, oh we wrote down the amounts we want on each card. The snarky jerk waiter says 'Oh, you mean follow the directions, ok.' So much attitude! So rude. I wish we left no tip, cuz that's what was deserved. NEVER AGAIN.\",\n",

My husband and I woke up this morning with a burning desire for a good bagel, corned beef on rye, and a knish.  So I schlepped all the way up to the PV Mall to get it.\\n\\nOk, first of all, the decor is terribly schlocky.  Its kind of like the tourist trap Jewish deli you find in Times Square.

The bottom of the bagel was entirely too thick and was very hard.  They didn\\'t even cut it all the way through, probably because the crust is too thick! \\n\\nCorned beef on rye- Meh.  The corned beef wasn\\'t very good, it wasn\\'t corned enough.  If they make their own they didn\\'t use a piece of brisket that was fatty enough.  The rye (which was not marble rye...) was lackluster.   It couldn\\'t handle the corned beef, became soggy, and eventually fell apart.  The pickle it came with was the grossest thing I\\'ve ever seen.  And it was definitely a kosher dill, even though I asked for a half sour.  The potato salad was actually really good though.\\n\\nKnish- Terrible.  The knishes in my elementary school cafeteria were better than this.  First of all, the outer crust was way too flimsy.  It should have been much, much, thicker, especially considering the gargantuan size of the knish.  We essentially ate a large plate of mashed potatoes.  The potato inside itself was unremarkable.  Not only do I have this Jewish thing going on but I\\'m also Irish....I\\'ve never met a potato dish I didn\\'t like.  Until today.  I didn\\'t even finish my half of the knish. \\n\\nNow for the prices.  What\\'s with this meshugas?  $2.29 for a bagel with cream cheese is a tad much.  In NY they run you about $1.35.  The corned beef sandwich was $12.50!  Now, I\\'ve paid that much for sandwiches in NY before but you get 2 lbs of meat and several layers of sandwich!  This was not a $12.50 sandwich.  I was also going to get us some whitefish salad to sample but at $15.99/lbs it wasn\\'t happening.  \\n\\nWhy anyone should schlep all this way, in this heat, schvitzing all over, for this dreck?  I don\\'t know!',\n",

They do have outdoor seating, but again, they lost points with me for only having tables for either 2 or 4.

Although I will probably go again because my kids do enjoy it and I was able to get the last paid parking spot (at 11am).  I have been to this event and others in downtown Glendale and they can't handle the volume of people that go to these things.  Downtown Glendale is similar to downtown Scottsdale but 1/10th the size and capacity.  There are tons of little shops in a historic district with ONE parking garage and whats worse is you will pass many empty lots that they pay cops to stand around just to make sure you dont park there.  I finally ask a police officer where CAN we actually park.  Anyway, the event was cool with lots for the kids, it is a farmers market that sells food you would find at the fair thrown in with some chocolate vendors, jumpers and carnival type rides for the kids in separate areas that require separate tickets for each area (this was way annoying too).  Glendale could do better by putting up directories everywhere for people to know where they are, where bathrooms are, and they could spread things out and offer more space per human being (I am sure this place is stupid in the evening).  Plus they need to do something about parking, even if they build a HUGE garage and charge $20 a car at least there would be options for people who dont want to walk a mile before they walk around for miles....\\n\\nAll that said, we will probably go next year because we still do not know the definition of insanity.\",\n",

The prices reflect all of this, but it's still pretty reasonable. \\n\\nSellers - as long as you didn't buy the ugliest couch in the world and you didn't let your dogs hump on it, then it'll probably sell here. They will look at your furniture first before allowing you to bring it in so you aren't wasting anyone's time. You can even bring in a picture and a pillow if that's easier. In fact, you can even email a photo to them that they will go by. \\n\\nIf it sells, they will give you anywhere from 45 to 55 percent of the money collected. To find out if it has sold, you can call. For security reasons, they won't give out much information over the phone, so you must bring in your paperwork to even ask how much it sold for. This is pretty annoying and inconvenient - they should do email notifications at least - but you can go into any location to get this information at least.\\n\\nI got the impression that they will let you set your own price, but typically they will price your items for you. Good. Compared to what you would probably get for them if you sold them yourself on your driveway, you're going to be happy (even when you realize you're only getting half the amount they set). They will also sometimes come pick up your items if you need help. \\n\\nBuyers - the store is laid out pretty well and they seem to only take quality items that would sell, so you won't find a bunch of ugly donated junk. Some of the items are out of date, but still in good shape. You're probably not going to find some grossly under priced antique that you could flip at an auction, but if you need to fill up a room in your house - it's a good place to shop. \\n\\nWeekends seem to be busy for them, so I imagine their stock changes constantly.

There were only about ten people in front of us, so we felt we scored!  \\n\\nI am a big fan of Texas BBQ, namely beef ribs and brisket.  I usually go for the lean brisket and light to no sauce (in true TX form).  \\n\\nLast night we ordered the moist brisket ($12.98/lb), coleslaw and a turkey sandwich ($4.99) for DD.\\n\\nWith three fountain drinks, the price was about $21.  DH also went back and got the banana pudding and the chocolate pudding for DD and himself.  I think he spent about $6 on that.\\n\\nTHE FOOD:  The brisket was DELICIOUS.  It was perfectly smoked and not too fatty for my tastes.  It had a good amount of char on the outer edges, which is my favorite.  The meat stood alone on its own.  Very good sign!  I did try both the Sissy Sauce and the BBQ Sauce.  The BBQ sauce was quite good.  \\n\\nThe turkey was smoked, which is not my favorite, but it was pretty good.  DD ate it after making me remove the \"black edges\" off and getting her two slices of bread instead of the bun it came on.  That was fine with me because I put my brisket on the bun with some BBQ sauce and I was a happy camper.\\n\\nThe coleslaw was good.  It was sweet, but not too sweet.  It was crunchy and a little reminiscent of the KFC coleslaw, tbh.  \\n\\nWe were disappointed that they did not have any mac n cheese.  Mac n Cheese goes great with brisket!!!\\n\\nDESSERTS: The chocolate pudding was yummy and had an oreo cookie crust at the bottom.  \\n\\nThe banana pudding was just okay.  A friend of mine gave me a recipe for banana pudding years ago that is really simple and appears to use the same ingredients, but is far superior.  I wonder if I should share it with Rudy\\'s?!  \\n\\nOverall, we will definitely get Rudy\\'s again.  However, we will probably just order the brisket to go.

My husband got the tri-tip steak sandwich and he said that it was delicious.  The meat was very tender and cooked perfectly.  I loved the fact that they serve sweet potatoes fries.  Those have become very popular lately but this is the only fast food place I know of that has them.    The ones I tried were cooked perfectly and very lightly salted.  The onion rings were also cooked just right with no soggy pieces.  I thought that the batter to onion ratio was slighly scewed toward the former but my hubby thought they were perfect.  Their regular fries are also very good.  I tried the chocolate shake and it was really yummy too.  I think its great that you can get a veggie burger here as well as a tuna steak sandwich.  The extra toppings they offer such as sauteed mushrooms, avacado, and teriyaki and BBQ sauce are all a big plus as well.\\n\\nThe decor is simple since it is a fast food joint.  The booths were big and comfy and the faux leather looked slightly more upscale than you would expect.  We went on opening day so the service was phenominal.  We didn't have to wait long for our order and everything was to our specifications.  Servers came by serveral times to pick up trash and offer to refill our drinks.  The restroom was very small but clean. I try not to eat fast food too often but I will consider coming back next time I am craving a burger.  Or maybe I'll give one of their salads a try.

The waiter comes by after about 5 minutes and asks us for drinks or apps and we ordered the burrata as an app. The menu said it was topped with a balsamic glaze, which sounded wonderful. We were also ready to order our pizza but the waiter disappeared immediately after taking our app order. So we wait. and wait. and wait. And I swear it felt like it was a half hour, but it was probably more like 10-15 minutes later (we were super hungry) the waiter came back to take our pizza order. We ordered the La Noce and he left. Well.... we waited some more. Finally got our burrata and it was a mess. Two giant globs of cheese with the lightest drizzle of balsamic dressing (not vinegar, because there is no way this weak stuff was straight up vinegar) surrounded by bread and prosciutto. It was large, so I'll give them that.... but too large in my opinion, because there isn't enough bread for the toppings. The burrata was good, creamy.... but it didn't taste like balsamic at all, which was the most appealing part of the app. The prosciutto was alright... it didn't have a ton of flavor, but it was fine. The bread had a burnt flavor... not my fave. Then we wait about 20 minutes.... waiter did not check on us.... Finally get the pizza. The pizza was good. That was the redeeming item of the night. It had arugula, walnut, ricotta, and mozz. It was a tasty combination.\\n\\n Now, the whole time we were there, there was a table of about 6-8 extremely loud, drunk, possibly old sorority girls sitting near us. All we could hear is their conversation, so much so, that we knew one girl was named rochelle and one was Tina and one had been divorced for 4 years and they had a friend named Lori who was just sooo crazy among many other details that we should not have gathered from sitting in their proximity, which obviously puts a damper on the experience. The waiter was so occupied with them, that we felt forgotten about all night. He was not attentive, he did not ask how things were, and he disappeared for long periods of time to go do who knows what for this other table (they had a bunch of ridiculous requests like splitting the bill 6-8 ways when the menu says they don't do that... hmmm). We sat down at 5:45 and barely got out of there around 7 to make it to our show (we were walking).

Third time I ordered bacon, which was listed as available on the web site, and then contacted and advised it was not and may not be available for a few weeks.  Since I paid upon ordering, I had to go through the hassle of waiting for a refund.\\n\\nI've also noticed inconsistency in portion size which is a problem considering you pay by product, rather than pound.  Boneless chops should be roughly 6-oz each, yet I've received 4-oz chops at times, resulting in 50% less product for the same price.  Not a deal breaker for me, but something to consider.\\n\\nI continue to purchase from these guys regularly, but no longer try to order ahead.

I've also been to events at many of these locations and more and I've always been blown away by how beautiful these hotels are and how incredible the service has been.  I agree with some of the other reviewers that the Ritz sets a standard for other hotels, and they are known for luxury!\\n\\nWhen I recently spent the night at the Ritz-Carlton Phoenix, I was not as blown away... the room was just ok - nothing so special, and I don't have any major complaints but I guess with my past experience and the reputation of the Ritz in general, I expected more.  (Don't hate me, Ritz-Carlton; I'm still a fan, but maybe not so much of the Phoenix location compared to the rest).\\n\\nI will say that we did get a discounted room rate because I was being honored as one of AZ's Finest and that's where the black-tie gala took place... and it was quite the event as well - we had a blast!  \\n\\nI took advantage of the fitness room for a quick workout after we checked in, and it was one of the nicer hotel fitness rooms I've seen in awhile.  Unfortunately, the pool was closed for renovation during our stay, so my BF could not swim on site, but luckily they shuttled him over to the Biltmore to swim instead.\\n\\nSo, overall, it was a pleasant experience - I just can't bring myself to give 5 stars like I would at any of the other Ritz-Carltons I've been to... but stay tuned for my review of the Ritz-Carlton, Bachelor Gulch (which is where I'll be heading in December for a wedding) - that one looks like it may be the best one I've seen yet!\",\n",

Taco Felix is a godsend for anyone who falls into one or more of the above categories. It provides decent and affordably-priced Mexican food 24 hours a day and best of all, it has a drive-through. \\n\\nMy husband and I tried this place for the first time for lunch today. We went at a standard time of day because this place is just a few blocks from us and we wanted to see if it was decent before we tried it out one night after midnight after karaoking it up at Silver Pony (just a block or so away). We ordered 4-5 different items - rolled tacos, bean tostada, carne asada taco, quesadilla supreme, and a chile relleno - and a large soda, and it only came out to $12! As a side note, the credit card receipt didn't provide a space to leave a tip, so you should bring a few bucks to thank the employee working for their efforts. \\n\\nThe only major downside was that it took quite a while for our food to come, since the drive-through was hopping (lots of people getting menudo after a crazy Friday night, I'm assuming) and there were only 2 chefs and one server (who had to take and serve both drive-through and eat-in orders). However, the food was definitely decent and the portions really sizable, and we felt that it was a great value for our money. Now that we know Taco Felix serves good food for good prices, we won't hesitate to come back during one of those unusual times - to get a chorizo/egg burrito on the way to an early morning flight, to grab a mid-afternoon snack when most other places are closed, or to fill our stomachs late one night after a few drinks.\",\n",

It took almost twenty minutes to order two pizzas and onion straws.  Then, the pizzas came out before the onion straws.  How do you cook pizza faster than deep frying an onion?

The difference was that in Waikiki there was a \"Hawaiian\" slant to everything and the live music was much, much better.  (And of course the beach front setting).

There\\'s a small upstairs patio, with a fireplace (wasn\\'t on when I went) that could be a great spot to hang. It\\'s not much of a view, but there\\'s something cool about being at a higher elevation. \\n\\nFinding J. Chew was a little bit of a challenge. We ended up stopping at AZ88 to ask for directions. LOL! When we arrived, my friend and I sashayed up to the bar. Immediately we had a drink menu in front of us. I was more intrigued by the huge crystal ball-esque 20 Questions game. I wanted to play!\\n\\nWhen I asked about beer, the \\'tender motioned to the shelf above his head. Ahh... Not a great selection, but it\\'ll do. I went with the Honey Brown. $4.50. Great price. Okay beer. I\\'ll order something else next time, if I can make up my mind. Stella? Fat Tire? Hmm... \\n\\nThe whole reason for venturing to J. Chew was for a celebration. My friend was getting married, and this was her final Saturday night as a \"single.\" So, the group of women sat outside on the small patio area. It was a cold, chilly May evening and they had the fireplace going. They also had a couple heat lamps working, but most of them were out of propane. Bummer. We Phoenix Dwellers were shivering our coconuts off, if you know what I mean. (Praise Allah for fingerless gloves, which were a big hit that night.) But, the bartender did try and keep them going, so we appreciated his efforts!\\n\\nOverall, I like J Chew. Yet I can\\'t rate it higher than 3.5 for a few reasons. Yes, one is the beer selection. While it\\'s small, it\\'s also doable. Yet, their mixed martini list looked disgusting. Then again, I don\\'t do martinis. Nor do I throw down $11 on a mixed drink. \\n\\nBut the real annoyance came from other patrons. From one guy in a hockey jersey throwing himself against the glass door (even hitting his head on the glass, when prompted) to a crazy D\\'Backs fan yelling in the face of a calm Braves supporter, those couple of guys just totally zapped the cool, calm and collected from J. Chew & Co. There\\'s something defeating and sad about seeing another man yell \"Lock it up!\" at another man, during what could be a calm, mature discussion about two sports teams they individually love and follow. There\\'s something even sadder about watching an aging man with a cigar hit on a married woman. He just wouldn\\'t leave our group alone. Oh well...Maybe they won\\'t be there when I go back... because I think if they are, I\\'m gonna have to say something. How obnoxious. \\n\\nIf you\\'re in Old Town and looking for a chill spot to hang, this is your place. Plus, I liked the music they had on rotation... From Modest Mouse and Postal Service to 90\\'s grunge and alternative rock, I was diggin\\' the tunes, along with the laid back atmosphere, the great service and the knowledge that there was a chill place in Snottsdale to hang. Who knew?! I just don\\'t think there\\'s a strong enough draw to hang at this place all night. This is more of your \"before dinner\" or \"before another bar\" type of estabilshment. Only problem is there\\'s not many other cool places in the area I\\'d be interested in going, especially on a Saturday night when Snottsdale is out in full force.',\n",

I think I've been too spoiled by the Japanese festivals in San Francisco, since the food selection here was more limited and there wasn't as many booths to buy things from.  I did like the cultural shows, such as the taiko and the martial arts demonstrations, and the shaded area with the bonsai and akitas was nice.

I arrived w/ high expectations, of both the ambience and the food, and I wasn't disappointed... much.  The service was a bit spotty at times- we were immediately greeted when we entered and were seated quickly, but the wait that came after water delivery was a bit long at a time when there were no other guests seated around us.  (Perhaps there were other guests seated elsewhere, but they weren't seated at the lounge, at the food bar, nor outside... Indeed, it seemed like were were the only ones in the room, besides the cooks at the open kitchen area, the servers, and the bartenders.)  Bread was delivered, but we were each given only one one-inch slice of a baguette.  How strange, especially when the butter cup held enough butter to spread over a whole loaf!  Whatever...  Two of the three dinner specials were relayed to us, w/ the promise of coming back to tell me about the scallop dish, but when our server finally came back ten or so minutes later, he asked if we were ready to order, so I had to remind him about the scallop entree... What was in it, and how was it prepared, and how much?  Hmmm, maybe he was ready to go home...\\n\\nCame in w/ Mom, so we had to try the calamari.  I also chose the Duck confit, goat cheese, and fig pizza.  For dessert, we had the profiteroles.  I really liked the calamari's coating-- lightly battered and fried golden-brown.  My fave pieces of the squid are also my Mom's fave, the tentacles, so these were soon finished.  At least half of the remaining pieces, the sliced bodies, were undercooked-- poor value for the $12 menu price tag (and I was charged $13 on the ticket).  The pizza* was TERRIFIC!  Loved the semolina thin crust, and the duck confit gave the entree a great smoky flavor-- I thought perhaps there were lardons included in this dish too, but all the smokiness came from the duck.  Mmmm.... The goat cheese was very creamy, and there were lovely chopped figs all over the place-- I'd order this pizza again in a heartbeat!  The profiteroles were fantastic, as well.  Three sliced choux pastry rounds, filled w/ dark chocolate sorbet, vanilla, and chocolate ice cream, sat on a pretty display made of chocolate ganache and creme anglaise, whole blackberries and blueberries, and a sliced strawberry.  More ganache was poured over the top of one profiterole upon presentation.  I asked if I could have more ganache, and our server quickly obliged-- thank you!!  We loved the crisped flakiness of the pastry (so perfect!), and out of the three flavors, we liked the fudgy dark chocolate sorbet the most.  I tell you, if I could've licked the plate clean, I would have.  :)  Excellent dessert-- I totally recommend!\\n\\n(*Pizza reheats well!

While I was a part of a large group of about 14, our particular group had 6 people.  One tablemate's entree (Ginger veggie stir-fry?) arrived at least 20 minutes before the second tablemate saw hers (Yellow Curry).  It was at least another ten minutes before the third tablemate saw his, and so on...  I was able to sample my neighbors' dishes of Spicy Catfish (battered and fried catfish topped w/ bell peppers, basil, and spicy red curry sauce) and Swimming Rama w/ pork (topped w/ peanut sauce over steamed veggies).  All three were AMAZING!  I'll definitely order the Rama and the catfish next time!!!\\n\\nDidi, our server, moved quickly, was efficient, and attentive, and was even helpful in suggesting alternate selections to those who had never had Thai food before.  She even warned tablemate Ericka, who'd only recently discovered peanut butter as an entree ingredient, that she'd either love or hate the Rama.  We were thankful that she rolled the dice and ordered it, anyway.\\n\\nI hope that the kitchen crew can work out the kinks as far as pacing goes-I hope that by next visit I can up the review back to five stars!!\\n\\nOoh, do try the coconut ice cream w/ embedded grated coconut!

       " 'Had some time to kill before the Ultimate pleY Date Yelp event, and I\\'d wanted to share my love of Nobuo\\'s Dark chocolate mousse with green tea ice cream and sugared orange peels with my happy-go-lucky cousin, who has never been here before, so we stopped by at 5:17p to find that Nobuo wouldn\\'t open till 5:30p, so we waited outside in the comfortable patio.\\n\\nAfter watching a couple of employees add lanterns to their outdoor umbrellaed tables, I noticed the \"OPEN\" sign on the front door, so we entered the resto, whereupon we were greeted warmly by a male host and shown to a two-top.  I didn\\'t like the energy in that room, so I asked if we could sit elsewhere, and he said to choose wherever we wanted to sit.  We were the first customers, so we chose a four-top, knowing we wouldn\\'t be taking up space for very long, anyway.  Glasses of water were delivered, and soon we met our female server (whose name on the receipt reflected \"Butai\").  When she laid down the menus, I told her we would only be having dessert and could we see the dessert menu?  I wished we had a video of the look she gave us, a look of pure distaste, as she gathered up the dinner and beverage menus and said \"We don\\'t have dessert menus, as we only have two...\" and proceeded to tell us of the mousse and the almond-orange fritters.  She walked away, and as we loudly discussed about our losing our interest in dining there, she came back with napkins and utensils and asked if we decided what we were going to have.  I decided to forgo our server\\'s very cold treatment and asked for the mousse.  After all, I\\'d already finished a glass of ice-cold water and cousin\\'s phone needed recharging...  \\n\\nWhen Butai placed our chocolate mousse http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0Buxoc0cRqjpvkezo3bqog?select=rK8m1rxl50PB69_c2YqQTg#rK8m1rxl50PB69_c2YqQTg on the table, I wanted to send it back.  Where was the lovely bowl and presentation of the last dessert I had here?  Was she serious in presenting us with this stale-looking mousse, with cracked edges and whose green tea ice cream had ice crystals on it?  I don\\'t know about you, but the only times I\\'ve seen crystals on ice cream is when it has slightly melted and placed back in the freezer to re-freeze.  For me, seeing crystals on ice cream is a sign that it is old...  I brought the receptacle and showed it to the male host, who assured me that all of the mousse is made daily at 4:00a and seeing cracks and bubbles in the mousse is normal, so I decided we would go ahead and try it, if for nothing else but to have something to report here.  The dessert was definitely not up to par with the pretty bowl http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0Buxoc0cRqjpvkezo3bqog?select=o9jIksB-MObhCxoI_msekQ#o9jIksB-MObhCxoI_msekQ I had during our October OYE in taste and presentation, but it was OK.  The mousse was still cold and stiff, and it had a mouth-feel more of like thick chocolate ganache filling/icing on a cake- certainly not the silky-smooth chocolate decadence I knew it could be.  My cousin had to warm up to the dish, as the sound of chocolate and green tea together didn\\'t seem like a great combo to her (I told her to trust me).  She also never enjoyed orange and chocolate together, but she liked it in this dessert.  \\n\\nI understand that the knowledge of having to serve only dessert instead of dinner AND dessert, which translates to a higher table bill, can be a bit of a disappointment, but why must you show your displeasure to your guests?  Butai, you were lucky that my cousin even left you the change for a tip- she didn\\'t want to give you anything, and you certainly didn\\'t deserve it!  When I told other Yelp friends about the sub-par service and dessert we just had, one replied she didn\\'t enjoy the last time we had apps here (I think it was around Halloween and First Friday?) either.  Cousin and I thought it very poor taste that our server gave us that awful, condescending look after finding out we were just going to have dessert; We didn\\'t deserve that!  I am never going to recommend Nobuo to anyone, anymore.  I even promised my Japanese friend (who lives and works overseas) I\\'d treat her to a dining experience here when she comes to visit.  Guess I\\'ll have to find another place to take her...  I don\\'t want to risk getting the same treatment from Butai, or from another server should we come back here.  \\n\\nSorry, Nobuo, but I won\\'t be returning.',\n",
       " 'It\\'s been awhile since this place was reviewed... and probably just as long since my last visit.  In the last few months (or possibly more), this restaurant changed names (it was previously \\'The Counter\\') and cleared out the retail boutique area to make room for more seating.\\n\\nFuture yelper Nancie S suggested we meet for lunch here today, and I was impressed with the changes.  By no means is Chloe\\'s Corner a high end restaurant... it\\'s more like a retro diner with a modern feel.  It\\'s the kind of place you order at the counter and pay for it, and then they bring your food to your table when it\\'s ready.  It\\'s also great for those who want to pick up something quick on the go...\\n\\nWe both ordered the chopped salad and a side of toasted cranberry walnut bread.  It was really tasty!  You can tell they use high quality ingredients... the salad is a unique combination of field greens, turkey, bleu cheese, walnuts, and grapes with poppyseed dressing.  I would for sure order it again although the tuna melt looked pretty amazing too!  There are several other \\'classic\\' items on the menu such as grilled cheese, tomato soup, milkshakes, etc...\\n\\nEven more impressive than the lunch was the fact that I found a parking spot right away at Kierland and I left without going into one single store.  I\\'m so proud of myself for that... any fellow shop-a-holics know how hard that can be!\\n\\nAlthough I did like this place when it was \"The Counter,\" it looks to me like the change that Fox Restaurant Concepts made to this restaurant was a good one!',\n",
       " 'I struggled a lot on whether to give this a 3 or a 4. Honestly, I\\'m not happy with my decision and I\\'m thinking it may deserve a 3. This place is new to me, but I\\'m no stranger to \"Mongolian BBQ\" as I\\'ve been a long-time fan of YC\\'s. Obviously I\\'m going to compare the two. \\n\\nI liked that they had fresh meat, but it was a little fatty and since they use thicker chunks as opposed to shaved and frozen, it takes longer to cook your food. They seem to stack up orders on the hot disc. It definitely lacks the flair you get when eating at YC\\'s, but the novelty of that wears off after a few times anyway. Plus, I know it\\'s wrong, but I prefer the frozen shaved meats to these chunks. It\\'s just different though - I wouldn\\'t say frozen is better, just that I prefer it. \\n\\nI would even go so far as to say I preferred a lot of their fixin\\'s outside of the meat. They had a better selection of spicy powders and sauces than YC\\'s, and this place definitely caters to the spicy food lover more. They also had better vegetables. I should also mention they have a better selection of meats including two types of beef and even shrimp and scallops. Even your choices of noodles and rice was more extensive. Come to think of it, they really beat the shit out of YC\\'s hands down in the available food department.\\n\\nAnd taste? Well, it was delicious I must say. Of course, I assembled the dish, so if it wasn\\'t any good I have to accept at least part of the blame if not all. If I had to compare, I\\'d say YC\\'s is very reliable and good consistantly because I tend to always create roughly the same dish. GG\\'s I could see having a much broader range of flavors and experiences. \\n\\nThe ambiance was okay for a strip-mall restaurant. It was kinda kitschy, but charming enough and fairly comfy. They had attention to detail. I think YC\\'s (depending on which one you go to) is a \"no frills\" sort of place compared to this. They were piping in some good contemporary alternative music as well... for a minute, I thought someone had lifted my ipod.\\n\\nService was attentive, but odd since this is a \"get your own food\" kind of place... They also have menus which is strange considering you basically put your own dish together and since the server explains the process again to you in detail. I felt a bit like a child being explained something so simple and obvious, but my girlfriend had a confused look on her face, so maybe it\\'s a good thing they do that. Regulars probably just get escorted over to the line.\\n\\nI think my main gripe with it was the tiny bowl they gave me for the fixin\\'s... but then again, you aren\\'t putting noodles or rice in there like you do at YC\\'s - they add that as they cook it for you. So I suppose the portions are comparable. Then there\\'s the price. A little high perhaps - maybe higher than YC\\'s (I know they used to be 5 bucks for a lunch bowl). But you do get a lot for your money if you know how to pack the food in the bowl. \\n\\nSo I guess I was right to give it a 4 instead of a 3... turns out I really liked it. I think this would be a real treat for someone who hasn\\'t had Mongolian BBQ before. I consider this to be a great alternative to YC\\'s... Impressive.',\n",

It's huge, spacious, and modern looking with its updates.  Escalators, stairs, etc.  The place is sparsely decorated with Arizona stuff that makes it really cool looking. They also have a cool light feature outside that illuminates the walkway with different colors at night and is really pretty to look at as well.\\n\\nThe cool thing about it is too is that its easily accessible via light rail, and you don't have to spend $$ on parking...and let me tell you, the parking here isn't cheap! $12 for the garage, $10 in lots around, and its not any cheaper the farther away you get.  I don't know why anyone would want to park down here, since the light rail is $3.50 round trip, so save yourself a few bucks and take the rail.

The only main changes in the front west room were the giant visages of the Queen and good ol\\' Winston glaring down at you. In any case, it was kind of hard for me to make the mental transition from \"this is a sit-down restaurant\" to a \"this is going to be your local English pub\" when it comes to the indoors. Was it nice? Definitely. It\\'s really nice inside. But pubby? No. That said, the front balcony is a really great location to hang out on, and I can imagine how great it\\'ll be around springtime. But the balcony\\'s more an asset of the great old house itself. \\n\\n3) Rose & Crown - The offerings. Standard selection of beers, including good ol\\' English standbys like Newcastle and Boddingtons on tap. Food menu not too big, but I thought the fish & chips looked appetizing, so I ordered those. I was skeptical, but to my surprise, the fish was great, as was their spin on the tartar sauce. Fries were also tasty, but fries are fries, and I\\'m going to devour them anyway because I was crazy hungry. But all in all, thumbs up on the food.\\n\\n4) Rose & Crown - The service. Was kind of there but more present at the beginning and then invisible near the end when were ready to leave, thus having to go back inside, tell the bar manager what we ordered since he didn\\'t have the bill, and then pay him instead of our server. Kind of odd.\\n\\nSo all in all, as I said already, 3.67 stars. I\\'m definitely willing to go back there and be open to editing my review and increasing its star wattage, but for now, it hasn\\'t completely won me over. Definitely has a lot of promise, with its abundance of Britpop playing and proximity to Bianco, the sporting venues, ASU, etc., but they need to work on being consistently open late before I think about making this one of my definite go-to institutions.',\n",
       " \"This place is all about the seafood.  Don't roll up to the Fish Market expecting a cool place to hang or a hip crowd.

Not until I showed up with my wife Audrey W to meet Kevin H and Marian H.

I did find it a little difficult to locate when I attempted to find the building - it is tucked away in the back corner of a strip mall parking lot. It was dark, late at night and took a few passes around the parking lot to zero in on the location. The staff was very friendly and the place was busy even for a Sunday night. For the staff and selection I give it a 3 star rating. It was good, but I didn\\'t find it any different than the growing list of competition. \\n\\nI know this place is popular and self-serve frozen yogurt establishments are all the rage now. The economic model is great - you pay by the ounce and have your choice of any variety of yogurt and any topping available. Customers have the opportunity to build it as they wish, which allows those with specific tastes to have their wants fulfilled more so than a traditional store offering the generic selection of choices. \\n\\nAll of that in mind, I don\\'t like it (the industry). Too many choices creates an opportunity for indecision and slows down the lines as people stand around wondering what to put in it next. For those new to the game, you can create something that turns out to be rather nasty - for example, the white chocolate sauce is really very sweet and I find if mixed with other toppings makes it almost unbearable. The other reason I do not like these places is that I do not like to pay for food that I then have to make and serve myself. I go to restaurants and pay for a meal rather than cook it at home because a) I don\\'t like doing it and b) I am horrific at it. While frozen yogurt does not require much preparation, there is still some assembly required. If I am paying, I prefer to have it built for me. But I realize I am in the minority.

The outdoor patio looks like a great hang out spot (but obviously it is too hot for any of that just yet) and the interior is small and intimate.  I was surprised when I walked in as it was much smaller than I thought it would be- but who knows where I got the idea that it would be a gigantic place.  \\n\\nOur server was hilarious and fun- he happened to be from Ohio and informed me he was a Buckeye (I'm from Michigan, but I'm not a Wolverine so Buckeyes usually don't hate me) and was pretty cool about taking my fun jabs at his home state.  He was super attentive and even was nice enough to give me directions home (horrific sense of direction). I kind of wanted to be best friends with him.  Anyway... \\n\\nI had the one organic glass of red wine on the menu (he brought me a sample first) and the Pasena.  Both were great beverage choices.  I also got to nibble on the tomato/mozzarella and flaked tuna bruschetta and was pleased with both.  I'd go with the original.\\n\\nI dream of the day that I find such a cute little place on the West side (feel free to suggest one if I'm missing it).

The staff was fantastic.  Our server, Alexis, was very attentive, friendly, fast, and really knew the menu (or at least was good at selling every dish with a very thorough description about the technique and flavors used to create it).  The presentation of the food is creative and beautiful. \\n\\nThe not-so-great.  The food is served in small portions at a high price.  I wouldn\\'t have a big problem with that, I actually think Americans should be more into tapas eating, except nothing we ordered blew my mind or taste buds away.  Don\\'t get me wrong; everything we ordered was excellent.  The food is perfectly cooked, seasoned, sauced, and artistically plated.  It just didn\\'t have that over-the-top \"WOW\" factor I was hoping for.\\n\\nHaving said that.  Nobuo at Teeter House is still a place that everyone should try out at least once.  It\\'s an enjoyable place to eat.  It\\'s probably a fun place to go with a small group of friends just to hang out, order a lot of plates and just sample what the restaurant has to offer.\\n\\nAs I said, the price can be a little high.  It took five plates and a dessert to create a fair size meal for just two people.  That came to nearly a $100 tab (with drinks).  But Nobuo at Teeter House is on Local Dines (http://www.localdines.com/?ref=19485) with a $50 or $25 gift certificate.

       " 'First off, let me say that I live almost across the street from here and have been waiting for a grocery store downtown for almost 5 years.  I was there the very first day they were open and have been back three or four times since.  I waited to write my review until they had their \"grand opening\" and until they had gotten into the groove of having a market.\\n\\nBoy, where do I start with the complaints?  The biggest complaint is not so much the hours but the DAYS that they are open.  Maybe I\\'m weird but I do my grocery shopping on Sunday.  We specifically didn\\'t get a few things from F&E because we wanted the ones from the market.  I try and go Sunday but they are closed.  Try and go back Monday...they are closed.  At this point, I really need those items and I\\'m just going to buy them from a normal store.  It doesn\\'t make any sense why you would have a ton of vendors there on Saturday dropping off their goods only to have them sit, locked up, until Tuesday.  If you need two days off, take Saturday and Wednesday off when the outdoor market is in full swing.\\n\\nMy next complaint is the selection.  I\\'m not even going to complain that you don\\'t have basic things like fruit or butter.  I\\'m going to complain that you carry fish from Alaska (not local) and that you carry Shamrock milk! WTF! You could be carrying SuperFarm milk, butter, and ice cream but instead you carry the same thing Target has.  Try supporting real local business instead of mega-giant Shamrock Farms.\\n\\nFinally, what\\'s with the \"wine bar\"?  Is it actually somewhere in the building or am I supposed to sit in the middle of the produce and drink?

They have suggestions and recipes for you to follow, from sweet to super spicy. Or you can always make up your own. \\n\\nThen the chef's wok it up for you and pour it all back into your bowl.  You can add some rice to it, sesame seeds or any other toppings that you want and choose a table to sit at. \\n\\nMy only warning is to vegetarians- you must ask the cook to clean off the grill before cooking yours because if you don't, you will get little pieces of meat in your bowl that have been left on the grill from someone else's meal!\",\n",

       " \"I've lived near Old Town Scottsdale for years and in all that time I've never really taken to the streets by foot, aside from a weekly visit to the Farmers Market. At first glance you ask yourself how many Indian jewelry shops can the area possibly sustain? Well the answer is, the turquoise market in Old Town seems to be doing quite well. So it was on a recent exploration trip that we happened upon David's Hamburger's and Mexican Food. So for me the idea of killer burger and tasty Mexican good is a match made in heaven, were talking major food groups here. \\n\\nTucked between 2 galleries, David's is a blink and you'll miss it kind of place, very unassuming and humble. Inside you won't be wowed by the interior design but what they do have is functional and comfortable. With TV's at both ends of the hall like space, you'll be entertained by performance videos of 50's era rock 'n roll. \\n\\nI usually don't write much about soda pop, well never, but in this case the Cherry Coke ($1.95) was kind of special. When you order a Coke you can ask them to add a number of different flavorings from lemon and vanilla to chocolate and of course cherry. David's version is wonderfully fizzy and cuts through the richness of the upcoming meal. \\n\\nOf all the ways Mexican style meat is prepared, the grilled taste of beef is my all time favorite. If you enjoy this as much as I do then Id suggest the Carne Asada Nachos ($8.59). A massive pile of crunchy tortilla chips is covered in grilled beef strips, melted cheese, guacamole, sour cream and pico de gallo. While basic, I ate most of them myself leaving my partner to scraping the cheese off of the plate. If you'd like salsa on your chips, be sure to ask them to bring you bowls of green and red salsa. \\n\\nNow who doesn't like a big juicy hamburger? David's doesn't disappoint with David's Single ($5.99), say that 2 times fast. A 1/3lb patty topped with the usual suspects, then dressed with David's creamy sauce which to me was a thick version of Thousand Isle dressing, adding a layer of tangy goodness. Along side you have your choice of fries or you can choose to upgrade ($.99) to a mix of large deep fried onion rings and golden French fries. For dipping I a side of David's sauce did the trick in lieu of ketchup. \\n\\nThe Patty Melt ($7.25) is classic diner food. We're talking thick ground beef patty, melted cheese and grilled onions on your choice of grilled sourdough or rye bread. The wholesome grease from the beef patty and grilled onions is absorbed into the bread creating a creamy like texture, for me this is what a patty melt is all about. Of course the Guacamole Burger ($6.25) with its pepper jack cheese, bacon and guacamole is the marriage of Mexican and American influence. \\n\\nIf you're an early riser, David's also serves breakfast like Bacon Pancakes ($6.75) and Coconut Waffles ($6.25). Someone please pass the syrup. My only question, where is the breakfast burrito?\",\n",

He said I should order the breakfast burrito, so I did, because he's pushy and I always do what I'm told.

Being a somewhat recent convert to pescetarianism, I got it with egg whites (cool that they had that option), spinach, green salsa and potatoes. The woman behind the counter made it up right there on the grill and it was warm and delicious. The potatoes were skin-on which gave them a great texture and flavor. The eggs were perfectly cooked and the green salsa had a great kick. \\n\\nThe hot coffee from the carafe I got to accompany it was airplane-quality, but next time, I'll just grab something from Cartel on the way back to my office.

       " \"On a cold winter day, the craving for hot comfort in a bowl makes a person do strange things. It found me driving to a kind of shady part of Mesa, while braving the cold winds in search of a perfect bowl of phÃ².\\n\\nMy new holy grail of Vietnamese restaurants is PhÃº ThÃ nh, located in a rundown strip mall on Southern and Extension. A good Vietnamese restaurant is usually kind of old, slightly dingy and super cheap, and in this case all the basics were met and exceeded.\\n\\nPhÃº ThÃ nh is a no-frills kind of place. Inside it screams for a makeover. Though clearly from another era, it is clean and functional. The service is friendly and the kitchen is fast.\\n\\nThere might be a slight familiarity here the owners of PhÃº ThÃ nh and my favorite central Vietnamese joint Da VÃ ng are brothers. The menus of the two places are almost identical, and they offer a lot.\\n\\nThe No. 50 ChÃ  GiÃ² ($2) is what good Vietnamese cooking is all about. Two golden-brown, crunchy egg rolls filled with shrimp and pork are hands on and interactive. Served with a plate of lettuce leaves and herbs, you wrap the egg roll in lettuce and garnish with mint and cilantro, then dunk them into the house-made n?Ã²c chÃ¢m, a sweet and spicy dipping sauce. The fresh lettuce and herbs cut through the richness of the egg roll, which on its own might be slightly oily.\\n\\nApplying the same hands-on approach, the No. 54 BÃ¡nh XÃ¨o ($3.95) replaces the rolls with a pan-fried rice flour crepe. The exterior is slightly crispy, while the soft interior is filled with shrimp and bean sprouts. Of all the BÃ¡nh XÃ¨o I've tried, this version is by far my favorite. It's full of flavor and texture.\\n\\nPhÃ³ (pronounced like the bad word) is not only fun to say, but fun to eat. Eight versions of the noodle soup are offered, from traditional beef to chicken. Pay attention to the menu description when ordering since you might wind up with unfamiliar cuts of meat.\\n\\nI'm adventurous and love the textures of beef tendon and tripe, so I was in heaven when my steaming bowl of No. 1 PhÃ² PhÃº ThÃ nh ($4.95) arrived. The broth was incredibly fragrant with clove and star anise. This really should be made into an air freshener.\\n\\nAlong with the condiments at the table, the soup comes with a plateful of basil and bean sprouts. But also include limes and chilis to add texture, flavor and depth to your pho experience.\\n\\nFor something hearty and comforting, the No. 7 MÃ¬ BÃ² Kho ($4.75) is a bowl of chewy egg noodles filled with a beef stew. Tender pieces of stewed carrots and beef grace the rich and complex flavors of the dark and tasty brew.\\n\\nIf you're carbohydrate loading, order a slab of French bread to absorb all of the bone-warming elixir at the bottom of the bowl.\\n\\nFor food like this, a little shady is worth the drive.\",\n",

It was clean, modern and consisted of a long counter behind which two employees busily hand-mixed tea and smoothie concoctions, along with a few tables/chairs. \\n\\n\\nThe menu was extensive and separated into \"black,\" \"green\" and \"white\" teas, any of which I could get hot or cold...I think. I picked the tropics white in iced form, and B got my second choice, a peach mix white. Both were pretty delicious.

I also ran into a good friend there who was delighted by the fact that they had this mystical \"boba,\" and so ordered a Chai-type version with blueberry-sized and -shaped balls floating on the bottom, and an oversized straw to facilitate sucking them up along with the drink.

There was a ton of cheese in the sandwich, but I don't remember which kinds.  The important thing is that it was really tasty.  My only complaint is that the cheese wasn't ooey gooey.  it was melty, but I could still make out the shape of the cheese.  In my book of grilled cheese greatness, it needs to be a little messier.  The sandwich was also served with a side of chips or salad if you choose.  The chips were good and I ate them all up.

Our two favorite dishes happened to be the daily specials - the Eggplant Barcelona and the Turkish Custard dessert.  But the Tortilla Patatas and the Gambas and the Spinach with Garbanzos were all great as well.\\n \\nNow to the negatives - \\n \\nFirstly, selection was dreadful all around.  The wine list was very minimal, and the very limited bar didn\\'t help.  And there were only about 8 dishes to choose from.  When I go for Tapas, the whole point is having a wide variety of small plates to choose from!\\n \\nEvery dish was DROWNED in oil.  Literally, bowls of oil.  The food just sat in my stomach afterwards, and I felt like I needed to take a shower to rid myself of all the grease.\\n \\nThe sizes of the dishes were very inconsistent.  I know it\\'s tapas, and I love me some tapas, but generally at tapas places I find you could likely split each dish three ways.  The Gambas and the Spinach were both huge piles that could have been split up to 4 ways.  But then the Tortilla Patatas was barely large enough to split two ways, and then our two favorite dishes - the Eggplant Barcelona and the Turkish Custard - were both smaller than a deck of cards and splitting them just two ways left us each with a single forkful of food.  There was a party of 4 next to us that put in 1 order of the Pork Tenderloin and the waitress said, \"You should really get 2 or 3 orders of that so everyone can try some.\"  3 orders for 4 people to try it?!\\n \\nThen, right along with the food size is the price.  $90 (incl tip) for the 4 tapas mentioned above, plus a glass of sangria, 2 glasses of wine, the dessert, and an espresso.  2 of the tapas were one bite per person.  Yikes.\\n \\nThe food, while good, was nothing outstanding.  There was no dish that made me stop and say \"wow, now that is well done.\"  They were solid but not amazing.  (As opposed to the Lomo Embuchado at Cobras y Matadors in LA that I was ready to marry and make babies with).\\n\\nSo all in all, I\\'d say a 3.5 star experience, rounded down because it just wasn\\'t a 4 for me.

We got started a bit after 7 and first we got our drinks and spent some time chatting and reading the menus.  Most of the folks there had been there several times before.  Everybody but me wanted pizza and wings so I ordered fettuccine Alfredo ($18.95) with salad and garlic knots.  I know it's un American not to be a fan of pizza and wings.  Their antipasta arrived and I sipped on my beer.  Then the pizzas came, then the wings followed by my pasta.  Somehow my order got separated from the rest and I had to ask for my salad and bread which finally came last.  The side salad wasn't earth shattering but was solid and the garlic knots were nice warm pieces of bread.  The pasta was delicious.  I mentioned I was not a fan of pizza or wings but I was coerced in to trying both a pepperoni pizza slice and a couple of Giovanni wings.  Both were really good, the pizza was a thin  crisp in spots crust.  The wings had none of the heat I normally associate with wings.  I had to take some of the pasta and bread home with me.  After dinner there was warm Zepellies and the birthday girl got this huge ice cream/brownie/whipped cream thing which her husband and I finished most of.  If you followed along, you will note I ate a lot of different stuff and I paid for it for several hours afterward.\\n\\nFor a large party we got quite good service except for my salad arriving late.  I just had the one beer (25oz) but most of the women were there to get their drink on and amongst them had several different mixed drinks and with one exception (weak) all were done well.\\n\\nThis is a big sprawling place with 2 bars and more TVs than I have seen outside of Vegas.  The original space which is sort of set off from the rest of the area has pool tables and darts.  There is a good sized outdoor area too.\",\n",

Well went there for a reason, after seeing Jewel of the Crown on PBS \"Check Please\", I was hungry for some Indian food. \\n\\nMonday night: not busy a couple people eating out on the patio, and a large Indian family eating there, seems like they were talking about the recent demise of Bin Laden and they had their children there eating and studying, so I imagine it was all owners family.  But they weren\\'t annoying and well behaved.  \\n\\nGreeted immediately, felt welcomed and liked the look of the decor with a kind of strange old time piano music in the background, they served us some crispy, spicy rice (?) cracker with two sauces.  I really liked the taste of those.\\n\\nOrdered the Chicken Tikka Masala (medium heat) and we also ordered, oh what is it called, chicken something with spinach, and garlic Nan bread.\\n\\nChicken tikka masala was very nice, it came in a kind of pot that was still bubbling.  I like that, the only thing was I would have preferred more spice, so next time will go with hot and not medium.  The other dish was decent but could have used a bit more kick, but that was ordered mild so that was our error.\\n\\nGreat iced tea, very refreshing and they kept it filled without asking.\\nI wish I lived in this area, all the cool restaurants are in SCOTTSDALE!! Son of a mother, why is that the way it is?  Not fair.\\n\\nAnyways, enough about me, I would definitely go back, heck I would even go out of my way from Glendale to drive over and give it another try, it was definitely above average.

I've been back twice and have been just as impressed.\\n\\nThe first time was for brunch, and I recommend the griddled corn cakes.  No, I just don't recommend them, I insist you have them.  Even if you are allergic to corn, take the plunge and try these...unless you might die, then stay away as that might be bad PR for PCG.  Topped with smoked ham (that's what I had), chicken, or bacon and served with maple syrup, it was beyond good.  I could eat this dish every day of my life.  The black beans were okay, but I do think the breakfast potatoes are nothing special and could be improved upon.  I was a big fan of a $4 mimosa, however!  Yep, you read that right...4 bucks!\\n\\nSecond visit for dinner, and I ordered the cedar planked salmon.  A generous piece of fish perfectly cooked and served with a delicious lemon aioli.  The accompanying roasted beets were not my thing, and the mashed potatoes were okay (maybe I'm picky about potatoes?)  I also tried a bit of my dining companion's beef tenderloin and it was butter-knife tender (that's what I cut it with).  Served with a stuffed potato and mushrooms, I believe, it will most likely be my next entree.  For dessert, we shared the Jack Daniel's croissant bread pudding.  We actually shared half, and I most generously took the other half to my husband who I left at home.  Although, I generally don't care for bread pudding, this is NOT your typical bread pudding and probably the best bread pudding you can imagine (other than that one recipe that uses a dozen Krispy Kreme doughnuts).\\n\\nAlthough PCG is a little bit of a drive for me (outside my usual 5-mile maximum radius), I will happily make that drive and return again.\",\n",
       " \"Are you one who likes the smell of a brand new car? How about the smell, or in this case, lack of smell, of a brand new gym? Now, for a limited time, a completely unsullied 24 Hour Fitness, at the MetroCenter, of all places.\\n\\nAt its current new state (it's been open for a week), this 24 Hour is in much better condition than the one on Camelback. No surprise there - everything inside here is brand spanking new.\\n\\nThe details:\\n\\n* In contrast to other 24 Hours in the Valley, this one actually will remain open 24/7 (versus closing at night on the weekends). The guy at the front desk said this is due to how this location is zoned vs the other ones.\\n\\n* The cardio area is equipped with 11 flatscreen TVs hanging from the ceiling, with one even tuned into soccer-centric GolTV (which means one less tuned to all those talking heads on brainless cable news stations - bonus). \\n\\n* The adjoining weight area is larger than the Camelback location and currently has all its dumbbells in place on the correct shelves, and all its weight machines are working. No new types of machines, though (this is a 24 Hour Fitness after all) but still all the standards, plus four flat benches and four incline benches.   \\n\\n* Full basketball court (which could also be split into two half-sized courts). Camelback lacks this.\\n\\n* Large stretch/ab area which also includes some contraption straight out of Tron/Blade Runner. I stood there and looked at all the diagrams, acknowledged that it must be useful, and walked away.\\n\\n* Standard group X classroom, childcare\\n\\n* A spotless pool area. If you've been to many 24 Hour Fitness, you'll know that this is a hugely appreciated factor. I anticipate it's not going to remain spotless for long, but doing laps in a crystal clear pool was awesome. No dankness here (yet). \\n\\n* Spotless lockerroom with wood-paneled lockers and branded Dial Ultimate Clean hair & body wash. I'm assuming the women's lockerroom has their own corporate soap sponsor (I find all this a little odd, but go figure).  But beyond soap, there's some contraption called SuitMate which is like a salad spinner for your swim trunks. Just throw your trunks inside it, press down, and in 30 seconds your trunks are water-free. How awesome is that?\\n\\n* Is going here after work safe for your car, you ask? Well, when I left the gym two hours later at around 9:45 pm, my car was still there in the parking lot, untouched. Seems like the MetroCenter is full of surprises.\\n\\n* All in all, a great gym that I'm sure will be a welcome addition to the area. However, it still rates 4 stars since:\\n\\nA) Although all the equipment is brand new and the latest edition of everything, there is fitness equipment at other gym chains that this one is lacking. \\n\\nB) I'm anticipating what the gym will be like in 6 months. If it manages to stay as clean as it is now by that time, maybe a 5th star will be in order.\",\n",

It was like a vodka slushy (oh snap I think I just invented something!!!).\\n\\nHere is a rundown of the food:\\n\\n* bread to start - excellent...love the lightly buttered and salted top\\n* tomato and mozzarella salad - excellent - one of the best i've ever had.  great dressing and ample balls of fresh mozzarella.\\n* pretzel fondue - the pretzels were excellent but the fondue and mustard were no bueno.  the fondu was gritty and the mustard lacked the kick that I love on pretzels.\\n* burger - pretty solid but nothing special\\n* mac n' cheese with Shriner's sausage - very unique and very tasty.  it was worth having once but I wouldn't get it again.\\n* tater tots - perfectly cooked.  salty/crunchy on the outside, fluffy on the inside.  The only thing that would have made these better is some type of aioli or other special dipping sauce other than ketchup.\\n\\nThe main dishes of the other people in my party looked excellent.  I should have been more adventurous and gone with something more than a standard burger.  Maybe next time. \\n\\nI was going to give this place 3 stars but I just can't.

I love the simplicity, the berries were not overly sweet, strangely artificially thickened. \\n\\nThe malt was nice and malty which I really appreciated and was rather thick even after melting slightly. \\n\\nNow the concrete mixer was the richest of the rich.

The chicken lettuce wraps and edamame are always safe bets and hopefully will remain on their menu forever.\\n\\nI'm sure I'll be back to Pei Wei because of the positive factors listed above - the concept is a good one, just don't compare it to a high end restaurant and enjoy it for what it is!\\n\\nPS - shout out to all the girls that came out last night - I had fun seeing all of you and can't wait for the next one!\",\n",

Yikes did I  just say I entered through the rear? Anyway a lovely staff person told me to go to the front and check in. Meandering through the cafe I really did find it lovely. Very neat, old yet modern and strangely very loud. It was a booming lunch crowd on a Monday. Taking Mom and Dad out for a Mother's Day lunch. We waited a few minutes for a table and were constantly being said hello to and asked if we've been helped by a friendly, friendly staff. Shout out to the staff! The menu, while not especially inventive, seemed fresh and yummy. The soup of the day was a tortilla soup with its own stamp on it. No tortilla strips atop the cup, yet and especially flavorful soup, creamy with a twinge of tanginess to it. Mom and I both had the turkey sandwich with cranberrry sauce. HUGE mother of a sandwich. I always wonder about the big sandwich because you cannot possible bite into it without making a mess. Not a strike against them, cuz it was very good, bread was fresh and turkey seemed unprocessed. Dad ordered the ham and cheese, but stripped away all the interesting flavors, because, well, because he's a dad and likes the meat and potato type menu. Dessert was a wonderful and decedent brownie with ice cream, chocolate and caramel sauces. Very good. Brownie was more like a cake though. Again, no complaint, cuz it was dee-lish. Service was so great I have to say. Friendly, professional and fun. I like the idea of eating in an old house. The contrast of old Phoenix with striking photography of modern New York strewn about the rooms was quite cool. I recommend a visit.

I'm giving 4 stars instead.\\n\\nAs many of the reviews before mine say, happy hour at Kona is great.  From 3 - 7, they offer 1/2 off a small menu of appetizers, sushi rolls, pizzas, and drinks.  (They also have a reverse happy hour from 10pm on I think).  I can't speak for the pizzas (I've never tried them), but the potsticker appetizer is great, and so is the sushi.  If I'm not concerned about happy hour prices, I've often ordered other menu items such as seaweed salad, edamame, nigiri, and the seabass entree too.  I've never been disappointed.\\n\\nI usually do not choose Kona as a destination, but if I'm in the area, at the mall, or someone else chooses it, I'm happy going to Kona every now and then.  It's good for what it is - take it or leave it!\",\n",
       " 'I had very high expectations for The Breakfast Joynt because so many gave it 5 stars, which means \"As good as it gets, Woohoo!\" according to Yelp.  My experience didn\\'t live up to that but I\\'m willing to give them another try.\\n\\nThis location was formerly a bar that was transformed into a breakfast restaurant.  The actual bar is still there, with a flat panel TV in the middle, but surprisingly the shelves are still empty all the way up to the ceiling.  They\\'ve only been there around 6 months, so maybe this will change as they settle into the location.  It has a very clean, upscale feel to it - something not out of place in North Scottsdale.  It\\'s also easy to find once you\\'re off the 101 onto Raintree, and then north on Northsight... it\\'s on the right and shares parking with Gold\\'s Gym that is easily seen from the road.\\n\\nI found the eggs to be good, and recommend steering towards the omelet choices.  Being from the South, it wasn\\'t thrilling that the biscuits were somewhat small and square shaped, almost like a little dinner roll.  They have their own style (and they\\'ve informed me that they are homemade) but I was looking for something more substantial to be smothered in sausage gravy.  The pancakes were not served hot with the other food items, and they seemed to have settled and were somewhat chewy and elastic.\\n\\nMenu was rather straightforward and clear with sectioned boxes, with a nice highlight of their featured stuffed apple pancake.  I thought the description of \"ham that falls off the bone\" was repeated far too many times.\\n\\nPrices were very reasonable for Scottsdale.  The fresh squeezed orange juice was excellent.  Owners are very concerned about customers with less than a stellar dining experience, so I\\'ll be sure to give the Breakfast Joynt another try with friends and family.',\n",

Out of the three small plates we shared, she only enjoyed the lamb kabob over quinoa ($9). It was the second-best dish of the three I enjoyed.\\n\\nI\\'d wanted to try a glass of rose ($7), since Mom is a fan, but she was \"too tired\" to have wine, so I\\'ll have to bookmark that for next visit. We started w/ the butternut squash ravioli w/ sage butter ($8; mmm... I adore brown butter and sage... My Mom, however, doesn\\'t). I appreciated the sweet creaminess of the squash puree against the slight toothiness of the ravioli. The sage butter added just enough salt to the dish, while the toasted candied pecan bits on top added impeccable crunch! How I wished I had all three pieces! (She ate one and didn\\'t even enjoy it! How infuriating! LOL)The second dish we tried was the baked escargots w/ butter, parsley, lemon, and puff pastry ($7). Compared to the multi-faceted ravioli dish, this was a bit disappointing. While I enjoyed the textures that the snails and crunchy puff pastry offered (TOO crunchy, if you ask me! Those babies were bordering on hard! Where\\'s the \"puff?,\" I ask.), the butter and parsley treatment fell flat. Mom again only had one. I believe there were 6 total. Don\\'t misunderstand- I still ate all the rest... I was hungry!! :D\\n\\nLast, but not the least, came the skewer of lamb kabob (3 pcs; $9) w/ bell peppers and onions, served over cold saffron quinoa w/ cucumber sauce (served on the side).

I like the hipster atmosphere and the food a ton. The drinks are weak, and overpriced, but the food reasonable. This translates over to next door where they charge 9 bucks for a well drink. They also treat you like scum. I'm only giving this restaurant a 4 because I pay a lot more attention to food quality and taste than I do service. I also love the fact they are open late.

The Chicken fingers may be fried or Buffalo style - but they definitely won\\'t be from frozen chicken.  They use only fresh Chicken breasts - no skin and no bones -  and they fry only in Canola oil to make for the least unhealthy fried chicken they can.  They have about 7 different dipping sauces - from Ranch to Thai sweet chili  - though they are known for their Special Sauce.  It\\'s a secret recipe, so of course I had to try it.  Pretty dang good.  I also loved the BBQ which was more tangy than sweet and went perfect with the chicken.  \\n\\nAs for the chicken - have you ever had chicken so juicy that you though it might not be fully cooked?  Maybe it\\'s just because I grew up eating overcooked food, but every once in awhile when I get chicken cooked so perfectly I have to look to make sure it isn\\'t pink.  It was SO juicy I was really shocked.  And though fried, it wasn\\'t a thick and overly crispy batter - just enough to seal in the juices while leaving you with a tender and flexible piece of meat.  The waffle fries were out of this world.  The Texas toast was SOOO good!  \\n\\nWhen I got back to the office I was super excited to learn two things.  This is an independently owned business - this is their first location.  And even more cool - they have gotten a perfect score by the Health Department more than six times in a row.

       " \"I have been to this place twice so far.  The first time I had no idea what to expect since I never heard of it before.  I honestly have no idea what to compare it to but I guess the closest thing is Texas Road House judging by the reviews here on Yelp.  Anyway, I know its not the classiest joint with the best food, but anything is worth a fair shot.  The first time my wife and I went we were in the area doing some shopping and just wanted something quick and casual for dinner.  We didn't expect anything great but to be honest our expectations were exceeded.\\n\\nThe happy hour is pretty good.  $3 pints and 2 for 1 cocktails/wine.  Both times we went we ordered a 2 for 1 drink which would have been ok if they didn't charge too much for the first one.  I mean $5 for a small glass of Yellow Tail?  They are giving you 2 though so I can't complain too much I guess.\\n\\nThe thing we love about this place is the 2 meals for $13.99 special they have going on.  There are some pretty good options if you stay away from the fried stuff.  So far we have had the chop steak, steak and the salmon.  They are all very good and decently sized.  They prepare them however you want (sauce on the side, etc.) and everything comes with 2 sides.  There are 10 or so sides to choose from.  I get a side salad and some grilled onions or mushrooms to go with whatever meat I am having and they are always very good.  My wife always gets some sort of grilled vegetable and they are good as well. \\n\\nThe service is very fast and friendly and the food always comes out pretty quick.  Oh yeah, and I also am a fan of their peanuts as well as the rolls that you get to start.\",\n",

When you first walk in, you are greeted with menus that are extremely reminiscent of Pei Wei.  Turns out, you order the exact same way at said restaurant and you even get a number and choose your own table.  As I sat waiting for my food, I contemplated whether or not this concept worked well for breakfast.  The place started getting busy about 3 minutes after we sat down and I discovered the concept works quite well.\\n\\nSo many things on the menu looked delicious, and I had a hard time deciding what to get.  For starters, they have pancakes with peanut butter chips!  YUM!  Any restaurant that does peanut butter chip pancakes gets bonus points from me.  The rest of the menu varies from omelets to brizzas (breakfast pizzas) to good ol pigs in a blanket.  The husband and I decided to share a few things.  We got the peanut butter chip pancakes, the pigs in a blanket, and a cinnamon roll.  The pancakes were awesome and HUGE!  After just one I was already feeling full.  The pigs in a blanket were absolutely delicious, primarily because of the yummy and kind of spicy breakfast link.  The cinnamon roll was also tasty, nice and fresh, but not too cinnamony.  \\n\\nBack to the concept of this place... once it had started to pick up again in terms of customers, I noticed how quickly the cashier was able to clear out the line.  I also noticed that the food was coming out at a really quick pace, and absolutely nothing sat on the line waiting to be served.  It works really well, but I am most interested in seeing how it works when the place gets absolutely slammed.\\n\\nOverall, this is an excellent place to try.  You will not be disappointed with your fresh and delicious breakfast that doesn't make you feel heavy and gross after you leave.  A cool place for sure.\",\n",

I left when I wasn't getting anything out of it and not much longer did they join with City Church. I think they are struggling but I have hope for them. Pastor Terry is the new head pastor and he has the Joel Osteen vibe, which isn't for me, but he is very nice. \\n\\nThey are non- denominational and love their congregation enough to handle sins or situations other churches don't want to touch in fear of being labeled as 'haters' or what not. I hope that anyone who attends will understand their views do not come from hate. It makes me sad that the other reviewer had such a negative experience and I don't doubt that she wasn't treated with kindess as every church seems to have those rude people. I am not sure what she means by 'closed-minded' but I know there are people like that at every church. I hope others do not have that experience and I hope the church can work on that as a whole. people need to feel welcome and accepted as they are. \\n\\nThey are also awesome with the community- homeless outreaches, drug addiction help, and so many things I cannot begin to list. If you ever want to help your community City of Grace would be a great place to get ideas of where/how you can help. \\n\\n If pastor Terry isn't for you I would recommend Cornerstone Chandler(my home church) or Central Christian. They are not closed-minded but they also won't ignore sins that are major issues. IE divorce, porn, sex, sexuality, infedility, etc.  Good luck on finding your home church!!\",\n",

Everyone had the same calm attitude and I could tell that this is a restaurant you visit to relax and still feel healthy when you leave. The menu is detailed but not overwhelming. The only overwhelming part was trying to decipher what each icon indicated and soon I learned that most of the food is gluten free, vegan, vegetarian or some other food lifestyle other than carnivore. But, for those not following an alternative food lifestyle, it's still incredibly tasty and makes me rethink my cuisine decisions! \\n\\nNourish serves breakfast all day (bonus) as well as lunch. It's a great brunch spot. The eggs Benedict is spot on. I can't tell what sort of herb or tweak they add to the hollaindase sauce but it doesn't taste like your typical eggs benedict. Their breakfast sandwich is tasty as well but a little bit more on the dry (and healthy) side. Their ingredients are fresh as is their produce. If they push the cinnamon roll on you it's because it's like a cinnamon god's protege and worth every calorie consumed. Plus it's flowing with frosting. \\n\\nNourish has a great patio for dining as well as spacious seating inside, but the patio is covered enough that even on a hot day it's comfortable to sit outside. \\n\\nSo in summary, Nourish is a good choice if you're looking for a healthy meal that will fill you up. I will absolutely be back and I can't wait to try some of the lunch items that looks tasty. \\n\\nNote: Be sure to check the times before visiting Nourish.

I was not a huge fan of the chicken and waffles, and I was so excited for it! The waffles weren't crunchy at all, which I think would have been nice texturally, and the chicken was encased in the fried coating, but once you cut into it, the fried part just fell off. It didn't adhere to the chicken at all. Also, it was very thick and didn't have a ton of flavor. This was very strange. The sauce on the waffles was good, it was a honey butter or something, and the chicken was moist, but together, it was a disappointment.

       " 'Had a fabulous time here with my husband celebrating my birthday last weekend. We both got \"The Farmer\\'s Feast\" and it was truly amazing. I was not expecting that we would each get unique dishes so that let us sample even more of the food (though the hubby didn\\'t really share too much). I highly recommend this option for anyone dining here. \\n\\nThe antipasti was a great selection of cured meats and local cheeses. Next, I had a wonderful salad that was a great combination of sharp peppery flavors mixed with sweet. Strawberries, arugula, radishes, yum! For pasta course I got gnocchi with a rich and tasty cream sauce and my husband got ravioli stuffed with yam. His dish was amazing, I had to fight for a couple bites. For the fish course I had poached halibut that was served with some kind of really flavorful sauce and a vegetable puree so that whole thing was extremely delicious. The hubby got a very lightly seared tuna fillet. I was very surprised that he enjoyed it so much since he is usually not a raw fish kind of guy. For our main course I got a pork tenderloin and the hubby got braised beef... just lucky we each got our favorite meats. Each came with other vegetables and starches on the plate so they would have been an ample meal in and of themselves. For dessert, I got a goat cheese cheesecake that was truly amazing. One of the best deserts I have ever eaten. Very rich but the pieces were small enough so that it was not heavy. The dessert did not have too much sweetness so it went well with the ice wine it was served with which tasted like pure honey. Just fantastic. The hubby got bread pudding which we didn\\'t much care for and it came with a sorbet that I didn\\'t try. I got the wine pairings with the meal and every wine just complimented the dish it was served with so beautifully that I was really glad I added that option. Also, it ended up that you got a half glass (at least) with each course so I think it is a good value (the wine pairing was an extra $45.) \\n\\nI do agree with a couple of the reviewers who mentioned salt. There were a couple of dishes that had just a tad too much. However, I think that was not due to a mistake of the chef, I believe it is just because they use cured meats in a lot of their dishes. Another reviewer mentioned bad service but we did not experience that at all. Our server was extremely warm and friendly. She was very knowledgeable on the food and could answer any questions we had for her. She also took the time for each course to explain each dish and in my case the wine and why they went together. Only one time did my wine not come out at the same time with the food course and in that case our server apologized immediately. I do agree with some of the reviewers that the service is very slow... however, I believe that this is intentional. They have created a very cozy and comfortable environment and they want you to linger and enjoy yourself. With the Farmer\\'s Feast in particular it took us almost 3 hours start to finish but I enjoyed every minute of it. It was nice to have time in between courses to sit and talk and relax. The spacing also kept us from feeling too full by the end (it is six courses after all!) or from letting the flavors from one dish influence the next. I was able to enjoy each course separately and independently with its own unique wine. It was pure food heaven. This is not the type of place where you would stop in for a meal before a show or event; when you come here, this should be your only destination for the night and it is such a great experience that it will be enough!  We truly had fantastic night here.\\n\\nOne warning I will say is for ladies, you need to be prepared for the rural atmosphere and the walk from the car to the restaurant would be challenging in heels (I had been warned so had wedges). In fact the dress code overall was a bit more casual than I was expecting. Kai at Wildhorse Pass resort is my absolute favorite \"special occasion\" restaurant and so we were making a lot of comparisons between the two. My husband made the comment that when we were at Kai we spoke in library whispers the whole time and felt a little awkward at times (you know the type of place where you feel like if you use the wrong fork you may end up getting kicked out) but at Quiessence we were chatting away the whole time and completely at ease. It is definitely a much more comfortable and relaxed environment then any other I have experienced at a restaurant of this caliber.',\n",
       " 'This place is so cool! The menus are on the walls in sharpie along with signatures from a lot of local athletes. They will not present a bill to you, but rather trust you to tell them what you ordered and pay the correct amount. The food is great, artery clogging, and comes in huge portions. I like the smothered chicken with yams and green beans, and order it every time. I always want to sleep off the rest of the day too. Saturday they do a great rib plate.

What do you want?\"\\n\\nDon\\'t be afraid, but don\\'t be surprised either. Keep your cool and order your dogs. Immediately start thinking about if you want fries or rings (onion rings) and be prepared for when you\\'re called upon again. Then watch as your hot dog is mutilated in front of your eyes and what appears on your tray is what looks like a hot mess of decapitated food.\\n\\nNever fear though... because it is amazing.

Whenever I know I\\'m going, I end up salivating like Pavlov\\'s dog for hours.\\n\\nThe booths are classic hot dog stand style and the pennants lined up along the top of the walls are fantastic to look at.

A big drawback is that while half of the seats face the lovely paintings the other half face the kitchen.  \\n\\nThe wine flights are good but the pours are inconsistent and not as hearty as in some places.  The bulk of their wine menu comes in bottle form.  They do offer 8 oz pours of wine for about $15 a glass.

       " 'Decided to give Tempe Marketplace another try after reading recent reviews (hoping that they had improved). I had to ask myself if we were visiting the same place. The traffic and parking situation are still horrible and the loudspeakers in the parking lot are unacceptable. The JC Pennys and Targets are crippled versions of their regular stores at other malls. The stores here all open too late (11am, REALLY???) to be useful in our uber hot summers (except for a Targets that opens at 8am). \\nEven though I am a Tempe resident, I will continue to choose the Riverview shopping area on Dobson over this mish-mashed monstrosity.',\n",

Also, there is a plethora of treats and toys for your furry friend as well.  The small animal foods section has a few small bags of hay, some treats, pellets, and toys.  I wasn't too impressed with their rabbit selection, and they did not offer high quality brands such as Oxbow which is a bit surprising since they have so many high quality dog and cat products.\\n\\nJill, the manager, was very enthusiastic and is very passionate about providing the best products for pets.  She showed me various treats, foods, and toys, and provided a lot of educational material on dog nutrition and health.  She provided a free sample of some nice grain-free dry dog kibble which is highly recommended on dogfoodadvisor.com, which I appreciated a lot since my dog is a bit picky with the food he eats.

I was irritated though when we were told they were only going to be serving sandwiches and burgers, nothing else, even though we were specifically told that this place would have breakfast all day.  Breakfast is what I wanted.  Oh well.  \\n\\nWe ordered the burger and got some mini corn dogs as an appetizer.  The mini corn dogs left a lot to be desired.  They were served with plain ol' ketchup and plain ol' yellow mustard.  Yuck.  The corn dogs were only okay.  The breading around them was way too bread like and it was just lacking in flavor.  The burger was enormous.  Unfortunately, what it lacked any flavor.  I guess what it lacked in flavor it was clearly making up for in size.  The bacon that came on it was equally huge, roughly 2 inches wide and at least 8 inches long... (that's what she said! Ohhhh!)  Anyway, I was obviously not impressed.

They occupy a buliding once occupied by Fate and Nine|05, the former of which was one of my favorite restaurants.\\n\\nEntering the restaurant, we were greeted with an odor of mildew and dirty water, which isn\\'t exactly a pleasant way to arrive into an establishment. Being the only ones seated in the small space, we were able to really examine it, and I noticed one glaring difference between the way they have it set up and the way it was set up; it feels like a cafeteria. The installation of florescent lights, heat lamps, and massive amounts of stainless steel in the open kitchen make this place feel like a lunchroom at high school. Whatever, we can deal with it. An overview of the menu showed several options which seemed like drunk food... fried everything, cheese crisps, foot long hot dogs, slider burgers, tacos, grilled cheese, etc. Apparently \"comfort food\" means deap fried grease? NO THANKS. I ordered the Braised Beef Tacos, which had the consistency of paste, but were average in taste. \\n\\nMy biggest gripe with this place is the microwave (not even a turbo chef) sitting front and center in the kitchen. Look, I understand that some restaurants use microwaves (usually not good ones) in their kitchen, especially if it\\'s a cold kitchen (which this isn\\'t) but having it in plain view and audible in the dining room is just atrocious. I truly hope someone from the restaurant reads this and hides the thing.

Everything from jewelry and pop art posters to handmade kitchen utensils, photography and abstract paintings. \\n\\nIf you go both in Spring and Winter, you\\'re likely to see a few of the same artists. For the most part, Tempe Arts Festival does a great job of providing variety. Plus, it\\'s fun to wander and look at things you may not have seen before - let alone expected to see at an arts festival. \\n\\nThis isn\\'t the most exciting of art festivals. There\\'s really no live music, unless you count the occasional melodies of flutes you hear when you walk by the vendor selling his handmade wooden flutes. \\n\\nI\\'ve been three times and enjoyed myself every time. I wasn\\'t wowed. I never saw anything I couldn\\'t live without. But, like I said, this is a fun event to mark on your calender for both Spring and Winter - even if it happens to rain during the festival. \\n\\nI give last Winter\\'s and this Spring\\'s festivals both a 4-star review, for the weather and company were great. It was my first year going, and I was happy to see that Tempe offered the Valley something that appealed to people who really do try and appreciate art. After all, it\\'s a \"consumer\" type of event, geared toward bringing the community and artists together. I can appreciate that. \\n\\nI give this Winter\\'s festival a 3-star review. The rain didn\\'t phase me. I can deal with a few sprinkles. What bothered me was the mixing of ASU and UofA fans, both groups beginning to gather down on Mill Ave for the football showdown. Don\\'t get me wrong, I love a good sporting event and understand team rivalry. I just thought it was unfortunate that the upcoming game and the fans\\' excitement took over the relaxed, casual feel that the arts festival usually has - you know, when you can walk down the street and look at art without running into an impromptu cheer section. \\n\\nYou see, fans were screaming in the streets - hollering insults to the other team - and waving their school\\'s colors high. (Once again, I understand the fun of that. I just didn\\'t expect it to be all over the streets in the early afternoon. Maybe I\\'m naive, though.) The fans were a definite distraction from the art festival. Knowing what would happen when alcohol was mixed into the equation, my friend and I decided to bolt. \\n\\nLucky we did. Seems like Tempe can\\'t handle a few rain droplets, for when we were walking back to the car, a street lamp post nearly fell on our heads. Talk about a commotion. \\n\\nI\\'d much rather attention be fixed on the art festival rather than any football game or falling lamp posts, no matter how dramatic both of those things can be.\\n\\nI s\\'pose this echoes the old saying, \"There\\'s a time and place for everything.\"\\n\\nWord to the wise: Parking can be hard to find, or require you to shell out $10 for a spot.

We had to just ask what can we order.\\n\\nWe ordered and waited, as the sun set it became quite dark as no one had turned on the lights. Another customer walked in but the waiter was busy working as a cook. It became even darker as we waited. The other customer finally was given a menu and the lights were turned on, however it was still pretty dark. \\n\\nOur tacos came, they were a bit small we each had 2.5 tacos I assume the 1/2 a taco to make up for the lack of chips on the side.\\n\\nThe tacos them selves were good, nice flavors crunch etc. for $8-$9 they should be good.  However the other problem sunk in as we were leaving, we were still hungry and after $21 and 45 min we were less than happy.\\n\\nThe next day they had posted a photo to Facebook, not about their food, or a special but look how how our waiter/cook is.   \\n\\nSo I guess if you want to look at toned male waiter this is your spot.

The anything-and-everything salad does have some good items included - craisins, pecans, egg, grilled chicken and a good balsamic vinaigrette dressing...but still it was a salad.

       " 'When I bought my house a year ago, it came with a big, half-dead front lawn.  I decided to do a desert landscape out there instead, & called a number of landscape contractors I found here on Yelp & also at the Home & Garden Show at the fairgrounds.\\n\\nI soon learned that this is an unprofessional industry overall.  I had several company representatives never return my call to set up an appointment to come over & do a survey.  I had others schedule an appointment & not show up.  I had others come & do the initial survey but never get back in touch with me with a price.  One guy I called said he would look at my yard on Google Earth & email me a survey.  (He never did, & I guess a $3500 job didn\\'t make it worth his while to come over for a few minutes!)  I had a couple of others who got back in touch but with only a materials list.  I had asked for a sketch of what they would DO with my yard for all this money!  After probably more than a dozen tries, I finally had 3 legitimate, complete surveys in hand to decide between, & the price range only varied about $500.\\n\\nOne of my surveys was from Tom Baird at Creative Environments.  After the survey, he emailed me a materials list & a CAD drawing that gave me a good idea what my new yard would look like.  I liked it, so I went with them.  Next, though, my job got handed off to another company rep, David Inness.  David was likable, but the job ended up changing considerably from the agreement I had with Mr. Baird.  For instance, I was promised that a BobCat skip loader would be used to dredge down 4\" to remove the old grass before the new materials were applied.  That & other promises were not fulfilled.\\n\\nOn installation day, three workers (& no \"Foreman Chico\" whom I was promised would be here) came out to do the work.  They didn\\'t remove the grass at all, but rather put down some black plastic material over about HALF (!) of the yard.  I complained, & one of the workers called Chico on his cell phone & handed it to me.  Chico explained to me that they weren\\'t going to dig down, or put down any more plastic, unless I wanted to go to the hardware store & buy some more myself!  I tried to call David Inness, but he was unreachable.\\n\\nThe materials included a big pile of dirt & a big pile of gravel to be used for the job.  The workers hand shoveled the dirt to form the contoured mounds as planned, but then only applied a very thin coating of the gravel on top, leaving most of the big pile on the driveway, AND LEFT!  That was it, they told me, & that I could use the rest of the tons of gravel that I had bought in planters around the place, or if I wanted, they would have it picked up in a couple days!\\n\\nAfter trying to call for a day or two, I finally reached David Inness, who got the workers to come back over & finish applying the gravel, which they did, but unevenly.  The gravel depth ended up being zero to 3\" deep.  I moved it around some myself to even it up, but I shouldn\\'t have had to, & since I didn\\'t get the dig-down preparation, the gravel was already skating out onto the surrounding driveway & sidewalk.  David had the workers now dig down a little around the edges, so that the top of the gravel would be down about an inch to stay put better.\\n\\nThis was the worst contractor experience I have ever had in my life.  The only thing saving it from a 1-Star rating is that the nice plan for the layout of the dirt & plants was followed, & the yard does look good now.  Of course I have a problem with grass coming up through the gravel, since it wasn\\'t scooped out as promised.  (I attempted to kill it ahead of time with weed & grass killer as directed, but all my estimators told me you really need to do both.)\\n\\nIf I had it to do over, I would have gone with Michael at Breese Landscaping instead.',\n",

I as told 10 or 15 minutes.  Not so bad... so I decided to wait.  I walked outside and met up with my Alexa and we came back in about ten minutes later...

I prefer cucumbers diced in smaller pieces so they are easier to eat!\\n\\n-Service - our waiter wasn\\'t the friendliest... I felt kind of rushed by him when we were there.  Additionally, since we were seated in the middle of the sushi bar, all of the wait staff would reach over us to pick up the sushi for their tables, which was very distracting while we were eating!  Perhaps they could\\'ve moved the sushi ready for pick-up to the side of the sushi bar to avoid distracting guests in the future?\\n\\n-The sushi itself was good; not amazing.  We had a Sunset roll, a Lotus roll, a Large roll, and an order of Ikura.  I didn\\'t realize the Lotus roll was going to have a ton of mayo along with the baked Lobster that came on top of it... it was a bit on the creamy side for my liking.\\n\\n-To top things off, when the bill came, they overcharged us... a simple mistake, but given our experience, it was just one more negative thing... and then when I pointed it out, I barely got an apology at all.\\n\\nWith so many other restaurants to choose from in the Tempe Marketplace, I am not sure I\\'ll return to Kabuki.

Chase nails this aspect solidly.  The concourse are rife with eating and drinking options.  You literally cannot walk 10 steps without tasty, delicious stadium food beckoning your fat ass to indulge; polish dogs, ice cream, 24 oz. bottled beer; Peter fucking Piper Pizza (Mmmmmm!).  The concourse also opens up brilliantly into the field of play, and one can go take a break from the seats but still have the ability to watch the action on the field.  Very important feature, particularly with baseball where sitting down can become monotonous.  \\n\\nThe actual field of play is marvelously constructed, with modern and classic designs colliding.  The dirt path from the mound to the plate is a throwback to the 30s, while the pool in the outfield adds a very unique and \"Arizona\" touch.  Pretty damn cool.  The classic clockface in centerfield is beautiful, and the grade of the stands are perfect for the noise to reflect off the metal structure.  Now that its under new management, they are opening the roof much more, which is a HUGE plus.  Many fans have been complaining about the lack of open air since the stadium opened.\\n\\nSo two things that I don\\'t like about the stadium, one ornamental, the other functional.  \\n\\nFirst, the hokey, 90s-esque mosaic on the outfield slats.  Jesus.  How about an update?  Its just looks so fucking bad, its almost embarrassing, and has prevented the outside of this architectural masterpiece from aging with grace.  How about HUUUGE pictures of current players, or true windows to let the light in and perhaps a view of the distant skyline?  This would require, of course, for PHX to actually knock down the Garage Mahal and actually build an outfield skyline.\\n\\nThis leads me to problem #2, the aforementioned \"Garage Mahal\", the most deplorable, atrocious boner yet for our mentally-ill city planners and officials.  What a total fucking waste to build the most useless and overly enormous parking garage that ultimately discourages people from walking through downtown before and after the game, restricted the potential for bars and restaurants to be placed there instead (fuck, they didn\\'t even give the option for ground level retail), and mostly sits at 1% capacity on non-baseball-days.  That would be 284 days of uselessness.  \\n\\nThough this isn\\'t the D-backs fault, it is a result of stadium proximity, so as a penalty, combined with those silly mosaics, it loses a star and red pigment.\\n\\nOverall, however, Chase field is the tits and will eventually be a MLB classic.',\n",

She was fantastic but with just 30 minutes, it felt like a tease... my facial made it all worthwhile though- it was pure bliss!  Heather was my esthetician and did a fabulous job.  I highly recommend her - she explained every product she was using as I fell in and out of a relaxing sleep while she not only worked on my face but my shoulders, chest, neck, scalp, hands and feet... the products felt amazing and smelled good too.

This is a brand new bar located right next to Seamus, within the San Carlos through an agreement with the hotel\\'s ownership. \\n\\nFor years, I\\'ve thought the Hotel San Carlos was an under-appreciated (through its own fault) downtown venue. With the Ghost, the owner has finally executed a plan to revive its rightful place on the downtown Phoenix scene. This is apparent from the first step inside the lobby, which appears as it did in 1928 when the hotel first opened. If celebrities in the 1930s had to spend the night in Phoenix, back then a small, un-airconditioned cowboy town with around 50,000, they would have stayed here. (Or else the near-by Westward Ho). You get a taste of those times with the massive photographic blow-ups the Ghost has put up on its walls of various scenes from early 20th century downtown Phoenix.

The interior would be mostly generic in appearance were it not for the somewhat ornate Middle-Eastern curtains, and a TV screen playing Uzbek and Russian music videos added to the ambiance. Large pictures of the main dishes in the counter area show you what they offer even before you are seated and handed a menu. For starters, we ordered Uzbek salad - tomatoes, cucumbers and sweet white onions lightly drizzled with a dill vinaigrette - and blinchik, which are crepes with a flavorful meat and onion stuffing; beware, the blinchik are rather filling by themselves. We also ordered palov and lamb kebabs. The palov was a dish of tasty seasoned rice with carrots and meat, and was quite a good choice. The lamb kebabs were juicy and flavorful, though the rice that came with it was on the dry side. A small basket of warm pita bread rounded up the meal. In all, it was a good meal, not great, but definitely satisfying. And I do hope to try the soup dishes next time.',\n",

I don't know if they have actual age or size restrictions, but kids younger (and/or small kids) would have a difficult time here.  One reason it would be hard for younger kids?  There are specific instructions for the contraptions which they go over with the kids before they are allowed inside.  Some have a max of 2 kids at a time (the obstacle courses), some have a max of 6.  One has a max of four, with three on the ladder and one going down the slide.  Younger kids would likely need to be constantly reminded of the rules, as they can be a little rigid.\\n\\nBoth my 4 year old and the 9 year old LOVED it here.  They both said they preferred it to Jumpstreet.  \\n\\nThe girls were bummed out when at ten minutes to 4 someone came in and said playtime would be ending in ten minutes.  Then the guy said if parents wanted to know why, we could approach him.  Upon approaching him, he said that two birthday parties were booked for 4 p.m., so they were ending Pop In Playtime early.  \\n\\nSome parents were VERY upset, having just gotten there less than 30 minutes prior.  DD was very disappointed.  It took a little prodding to get her to put her shoes back on and get ready to leave after only an hour of playing.  \\n\\nOn the way out, some parents stopped by and talked to the shift manager.  She just handed out cards for another session since ours was cut short.

       " \"Union is very cool in theory. I LOVE Royal coffee, so it is nice that they have a second location here (although somewhat redundant since they already have a location at the Biltmore). The little cafe smelled very good. The stores are cute and the set up is interesting...sort of like a public market or something where there are many small counter businesses or storefronts. My problem with Union is that it claims to be all local because the stores are local stores; However, there are items in some of the stores that are simply bought from corporate companies. For example, I tried on some dresses from the cute little clothing store and overheard the owner talking to some random supplier and saying something along the lines of 'Just bring anything, I don't even care.' The brands are not local and the clothes are not locally made. I think if Union really wants to be a 'local' establishment, the businesses should sell locally made, locally sourced items, otherwise it is just indirectly buying corporate made-in- China items. I know some of the stores have put forth a lot of effort to do this (Queen Creek Olive Mill, Frances, etc), which is appreciated, but as a unit, I think they could do more.\",\n",

Decent is the common word to describe Upper Deck. The food is decent, the drinks are decent, the prices are decent and the space is decent. On game day, the bar can get pretty crowded so its best to get there before the game you want to watch actually starts in order to secure a seat. The upstairs area has another bar and additonal seating, including some red velvelt couches. On the ground floor, TVs line the walls and a theater TV is on the center wall. So, if your game is playing on that TV it's perfect. \\n\\nI typically only visit Upper Deck on a game day, but in that sense they've got their niche covered because on those, the place is packed. Be prepared to wait for your food and drinks due to the crowds but if you don't mind large crowds and decent (not always so quick) service, I suggest visiting to watch a game. And if possible, you might want to eat before. The food is decent, but it's worth checking out some other spots first and having a snack at Upper Deck.\",\n",

I will say the cajun fries were highly addictive but I did not appreciate having to eat them out of the bottom of the paper bag they were thrown into, even though it wasn't a to-go order. And warning if you get jalepenos on your burger: this is the only topping that they are generous with. Which I would have appreciated if they weren't completely raw.

       " 'Let me start by saying that American Apparel makes fantastic t-shirts. I\\'m a serious t-shirt collector and have been for decades. I pay attention to that type of junk because I was involved in the d.i.y. punk scene as a kid and if you\\'re in a band, printing your own t-shirts was par for the course... From Anvil to Hanes to newer brands like Gildan - I\\'ve tried them all. For awhile it looked like Oneita was going to be the last \"made in the USA\" company around - quality shirts there - but several years ago, they seem to have dropped out. \\n\\nEverything has been pretty much Gildan - tourist shirts and event shirts and anything cheap or free - it\\'s Gildan. You can even pick up some blanks for a couple bucks at Walgreens if you like. The problem with them is that they are totally unreliable fit-wise. They react unpredictably to the drier - sometimes getting wider and shorter or twisting or losing hem threads. They also aren\\'t very soft - they are very heavy, but they aren\\'t very high-end. \\n\\nI realize it seems silly to have a high-end t-shirt, but that\\'s what American Apparel makes. Their shirts always fit perfectly - they are all made exactly the same and they make anyone with a halfway decent body shape look pretty sexy. They are somewhat fitted without being tight. They are all soft and the cotton is combed to a rich and durable state. These shirts don\\'t form holes as easily as other shirts I\\'ve owned - even heavier shirts I have form holes near where they rub against my belt buckle... AA do not. Their seams always hold as well.\\n\\nI can easily say that American Apparel are the most reliable and best made blank t-shirt available. When buying shirts online, I only buy prints on AA shirts because I know they\\'ll look great on me. So many online companies now use AA shirts these days as well, so it\\'s easy.\\n\\nSo what about this store? What about the rest of it? Well, the store is bright and full of colorful clean blank clothes. On the women\\'s side, there are lots of great skirts and dresses made of soft cotton. Mostly just summer accessories really as nothing here is thick enough to wear as winter cover. It is meant to be layered though as you can see by the mannequins. They have great socks and leggings and I\\'m told they make the best and most comfortable thongs in the business... so if you are a woman and you want to try some comfy thongs - give these a shot.\\n\\nThe men\\'s side is more of a unisex area because apart from the shirts, all of the clothes they sell to men are super gay... and I\\'m not trying to insult anyone, it\\'s just seriously things that are far too flamboyant for even metrosexuals. They definitely expect you to be rail skinny to buy clothes here although they carry larger sizes. They sell jeans, but they are of the skinny type. Some of the fun of going in here is to look at the gold lamet jackets and telling your friends you are going to buy it to see their reaction. \\n\\nThe kids that work here are hip scenesters hired for their look rather than their work ethic. They are all thin and their level of helpfulness varies wildly between \\'not\\' and \\'somewhat\\'. The store is very well-lit and it\\'s easy to find things. The models they use for the advertising and \\'artwork\\' posted around the store look like early-stage bruised up meth addicts or early 70s porn stars. \\n\\nThe biggest problem with this store really is simply that their clothing is overpriced. Sure, it\\'s nice and well-made, but it\\'s also expensive. Considering you can buy their blank t-shirts for 3-5 bucks each from online bulk sellers... the exact same shirts they sell in the store for 3-5 times that amount. 60 bucks for a jacket that looks like it would come in a 5 dollar hurricane survival kit doesn\\'t spell value to me. I really think the only good reason to go here would be if you were a girl and you wanted to buy some thongs or socks or leggings or a skirt or dress. If you just want a t-shirt, there are much cheaper ways to obtain them... for both men and women. \\n\\nIt\\'s great having an AA location in the valley if for no other reason than to just have it... but a smart shopper can do better.',\n",

It hit me over the last few weeks that I needed to get my act together and order a crib and dresser.

City Hall is the way to go!\\n\\nI've been to City Hall more than a handful of times through the years as well as it's sister concepts: Ocean Club and Mastro's in North Scottsdale.  You cannot go wrong with any of them.  I just happen to prefer City Hall because of the convenient location to where I live and work!\\n\\nI've been to meet a friend or two for happy hour at the bar, I've been for a bachelorette party, and I often go for celebratory date nights with my husband... as we did on this past Wednesday evening to celebrate my birthday!  If you're up for a bit of a scene, some live music and great people watching, I highly recommend sitting in the bar.\\n\\nLet me reiterate: this is a high end steakhouse.  Expect to valet your car and bring cash for the bathroom attendant as well.  But you get what you pay for.  Service is top notch and the food is the best quality I've found in the state and beyond.\\n\\nStarting with drinks, there are plenty to choose from.  I am a dirty martini girl and they make a mean one here.  It's actually two for the price of one, since they bring you the entire shaker and refill it when necessary.  Awesome wine list as well.\\n\\nIn addition to the complimentary bread bowl which comes with my favorite pretzel rolls in town, my fave appetizers are their oysters, calamari, and seafood tower if you're with a group.\\n\\nNext up, I am a huge proponent of the Mastro's House Salad.  Tip: it's large, so my recommendation is to share it with someone.  If not, you could easily make a meal of the salad, the bread bowl, and a drink!\\n\\nAnd for the main course, if you're going with steak, go for the Bone-In Ribeye, and if you're more in the mood for fish, I say Chilean Seabass all the way... you can split either of these also.  Both arrive on Mastro's signature hot plates, and they've always been cooked and seasoned to perfection.  Pair 'em with your favorite sides - you really can't go wrong here although my top picks would be sweet potato fries, creamed spinach, steamed broccoli, and grilled asparagus.  I've never heard anyone complain about the signature lobster mashed potatoes either.\\n\\nBy now, you're definitely full, but keep drinking or hanging out digesting until you make room for dessert.  Don't miss the Mastro's Signature Warm Butter Cake.  Thank me later!  You can't go wrong with the Key Lime Pie or Cheesecake either, but again, that butter cake is to die for!\\n\\nOn my recent birthday visit, I enjoyed many of the items mentioned above except for the dirty martini and oysters... I'm prego at the moment, so sadly, I had to pass on both.  But after this baby comes, I can't wait to go back for another incredible meal.  Who wants to join me?!\",\n",

I couldn\\'t discriminate, so I left with three different kinds: one chocolate chip coconut, chocolate oatmeal, and the special of the week...the lemon cookie.

After reading Mr. K's review down below, I'd have to say nothing has really changed because I had generally the same experience.  No one wants to read the same review twice so I will keep it short.  \\n\\nA few things:\\n-The rice was sprinkled with cinnamon.  I've never experienced such a thing and didn't enjoy it.\\n-The decor is ridiculously tacky.\\n-The credit card machine was not working, and he didn't mention this to us, so we had to run across the way to QT to get some cash.  He didn't seem very worried that we would not return, and was apologetic so I wasn't really mad.  It was a pretty hilarious situation.  When we both came back with $20's, he was afraid he didn't have the change for us.  \\n\\nIf you are wanting something a little different and in the West Valley (and not in a huge hurry), you should check this spot out.  It appears as if it is a one-man run business and Yelpers seem to love the mom and pops, so check it out!  Bring cash just in case!\",\n",

The last one was this past Friday afternoon and I declared that I wouldn't go back there again to my pedicure partner, Jeane F.\\n\\nI know it is a bit paranoid to think that people speaking another language around you are clearly talking about you.  In this situation, I wasn't being paranoid.  My mom used to do this all the time, so I can spot it in a second (even if the language is foreign to me).  I'm not down with people talking shit about me in front of my face.\\n\\nAlso, the pedicure was really sub-par.  The massage was non-existent and it really just felt like they were going through the motions to get us out of there.\\n\\nPedicures are only $15 here.  I asked them to make the total $18 which is perfectly 20%.  I got a dirty look.\\n\\nI also had some crazy lady try to use my iPhone and the clientele seemed a bit off on this Friday afternoon.\\n\\nNot a relaxing or calming experience at all... so, I won't be back for another pedicure and wouldn't suggest it to you, either.\",\n",

I'm blaming it on the vodka tonic and not the warmed over salmon roll, but eater beware.  The bar can get crowded too, but they have some fun watercolor boards at the bar to play around with.

If they were wrong about my insurance and send me a bill I will update this review.\\n\\nThe only downside is that they refuse to do anything more for you at the initial consultation if you don't agree to injections or put down a ton of money for a dental appliance.  If you are in pain they refuse to give you a prescription for muscle relaxants or an anti-inflammatory medication.\\n\\nAnother thing that put me off was that if you are hesitant to plop down $500 on the spot for the dental appliance, they try to negotiate the down payment like a car dealer and even offer you interest free financing.\\n\\nI'm going to get a second opinion from a dentist to see if Dr. Ferrall's treatment plan is legit and worth $900 out of my pocket.\",\n",

       " 'Given that I went to the Downtown Phoenix Public Market without any caffeination whatsoever, I was in a pretty gnarled state by the end of my tomato buying excursion. I wanted to sit and cool down somewhere and have some coffee. I immediately thought of all my regular coffee joints, but since I was already in this neck of the woods, I thought I\\'d check to see if Fair Trade was open.\\n\\nNow, it\\'s not the first time I\\'ve attempted to go to Fair Trade. I\\'ve tried several times before on weekends, and they\\'ve always been closed. And I\\'d forget their hours and then try again and...still closed.\\n\\nBut today? Open! So for all you people, at least at noon on Saturdays, this joint\\'s doors are unlocked. \\n\\nI walked in and surveyed the scene. I definitely got a Berkeley earth mother vibe, which I didn\\'t really expect to get in downtown Phoenix, but this town never ceases to surprise me one way or the other. I can\\'t remember all the stuff they had to offer for sale besides their coffee products, but I do remember it appealing much to yogacentric ladies (not that there\\'s anything wrong with that).\\n\\nOk, survey over, I still needed caffeine. I looked at their menu. The sizes for their coffee drinks: large, grande, venti. Are you kidding me? Why would a coffeehouse, called Fair Trade Cafe of all things, choose to label its cup sizes after Starbucks?  Beats me.\\n\\n\"I\\'d like a small hot coffee and a large iced chai. And I want the chai with soy, if you can make it.\"\\n\\n\"Sure, no prob.\"\\n\\nNow I know it sounds bizzarre to you, but I needed the hot coffee to wake me up (iced coffee does nothing). But then I wanted something to cool me down. Plus I saw people drinking iced chai at the farmers market and it looked good. And I never drink chai at coffeehouses, hot or iced, so I thought why not today?\\n\\nI then sat down with my two drinks on the couch and read the NY Times. In a relaxed state. And tasted my drinks.\\n\\nI\\'d say the coffee was good, but the iced soy chai was excellent. I kept switching back between sips of each. I guess I\\'m weird. Or maybe I was just hot from walking around in 100 degrees for an hour. Who knows.\\n\\nI sat there for a while reading, and I noticed out of 9 patrons there I was the only guy in the entire joint, so maybe it is an earth mother establishment after all. No Sarah Maclachlan on the soundsystem, though. Actually, no music at all. I know that there\\'s no rule governing coffeehouses and whether they should have music (either live or on the stereo) on at all times, but it did seem a little silent, apart from the quiet chattering at the other tables.\\n\\nI\\'d say all in all Fair Trade is a good place in a great location and uses best practices to obtain quality coffee (including Pura Vida Coffee and Just Coffee, which comes from a co-op of 50 families in Chiapas, Mexico), but man, if they were only open throughout the weekends and into the evenings, downtown would definitely benefit. I\\'m not sure if the adjacent Trinity Episcopal Cathedral actually owns the cafe or not, but I didn\\'t get any religious vibe from the joint while I was there.\\n\\nSo, 3 stars for now. Maybe I\\'ll bump up the star wattage in the future. Whenever I find them open again, that is.',\n",

Using the library though, is another story.  In the times I've visited, this location was either closed or full of noisy children and pre-teens who ran in and out of its doors unattended and people of all ages who talked loudly on their cellphones.  The computer section was always crowded, and I could never find a seat to use or an empty table void of backpacks and other items left there by their absentee owners.  I'd say that, for the most part, this library looked and sounded more like a coffee shop (there's a section where you can purchase coffee and some pastries) than a quiet library where one may hope to do some productive work.\\n\\nThere was a good-sized selection of CDs, DVDs, and books-on-DVDs, which I used a couple of times, that allowed you to place holds on-site and online, and this service was fairly prompt at notifying me of the availability for pick-up, but I quit using the services when my hands, and anything that the items touched, started to smell of body odor from the previous users that handled them!  (I think that many of the handlers carried the items under their armpits as they walked back to the library, which I'm sure we've all done before w/ books and other items, but think about it-- we do live in the middle of the desert, and bodies do get hot and sweaty...)  No matter how many times I wiped the items down w/ sanitizing cloths and washed my hands w/ soap AND sanitized them, the odor wouldn't disappear!  Utterly disgusting, and I'm not exaggerating!  Don't believe me?  Pick up a DVD or book on your next visit and take a whiff...  Don't say I didn't warn you!!\\n\\nCome for the relaxing/energizing walks and views around the lakes.  There's even a playground or two on the other end of the park for children to play in, and many picnic areas w/ grills and tables to use.   You can even go fishing!  [Just don't expect to eat what you catch, though-- the lakes are contaminated w/ toxins and algae (there are signs), and I've seen more than a few floaters and dead small animals bobbing in the water.]  If you plan to walk all of the paths, make sure you have a friend or two accompanying you, esp. around sunset, bec. there's a specific location that only has one entry and exit, which could become dangerous-- if someone's stalking or following you w/ malicious intent, well, you're S.O.L.  \\n\\nI hope your experiences at this library turn out better than mine!\",\n",

Fresh, muddled mint, a bit of lime juice, a spritz of ginger ale, sugar, and rum.  Initially I thought it a bit too sweet (from the ginger ale, instead of carbonated soda) but perhaps the alcohol content had something to do with my change of mind... :)\\n\\nI was considering a bruschetta plate with two cheeses, but decided against it when I had a look at the dessert menu.  Nope, I\\'m just going to have a small plate of Pesto chitarra ($10) and perhaps the cherry zeppole later.  I have to tell you, I\\'ve been dreaming about this pasta dish for years, since the first time I saw another Yelper post a picture of it somewhere.  Years!!  And today\\'s dish did not disappoint.  No, not at all.  You\\'d think after a few years\\' buildup on how spectacular this plate looks, I might not enjoy it so much, but I was happy with it.  Yep, I\\'m just going to come out and say it-- I ate the whole thing!  Every \"guitar\" string, all the grape tomato halves (which, honestly, wasn\\'t hard to do, since there were only two whole pieces to speak of), each and every grated parmesan-coated pine nut, and all of the pesto sauce. I may have left some charred bits of the toasted focaccia bread on the plate, but what wasn\\'t charred I used to sop up all of that pesto-infused EVOO.

And yes, I ate all six of them, and all of the almond crema.  There was no doubt that the mascarpone contained bourbon- it\\'s pretty strong, and I didn\\'t mind it, not at all, especially when you combine it with the almond, but had I known just how much i\\'d enjoy the almond crema, I\\'d have them give me two pots of it, instead of the mascarpone.

Why is it that places like PF Chang\\'s are considered \"like, oh my god, sooo good!\"? Why? \\n\\nI mean, the food is edible. It has flavor. The  menu offers variety. You get to eat your food in a comfortable setting with somebody waiting on you, refilling your glass, clearing the table... And then you get to go back to your ordinary lives.\\n\\nOk, so maybe I\\'m being a little too hard on PF Chang\\'s. I\\'m not the first person to diss chain restaurants. I\\'m not even the first to secretly admit to liking a few. I do. But, when given the option of exploring a local eatery that sells more than the \"paint by numbers\" entrees, I\\'ll pick the original, exciting and off-the-beaten-path place 99.4% of the time.',\n",
       " 'First, I think it\\'s important to remember what L\\'Academie is: this is Scottsdale Culinary Institute\\'s casual, bistro-style restaurant. As such, every encounter with staff is an encounter with a student, from the host stand to the table service to the kitchen. \\n\\nLast night, we spotted the fruit and cheese plate on the dessert table upon our entrance. You see, while the menu is seasonal (maybe to coincide with semesters?), the desserts are changed out more frequently to allow for creativity of the student chefs. The offerings are displayed along with some featured beverages which you are forced to pass as you enter the dining room... a great way to remind you to save room (wink, wink). I guess you could say we had dessert first!\\n\\nOur \"starter\" featured slices of Manchego, and wedges of blue cheese and a smokey brie bordered by walnuts, pistachios, dried figs, apricots and cranberries and halved red and green grapes. Only real complaint: there were too few pieces of crostini (although we were graciously brought more upon request) and some of the green grapes had browned. Overall, it was a nice way to start the meal.\\n\\nI had the five onion soup. A velvety potage, the soup\\'s aroma was slightly better than its flavor. A bit heavy on the pancetta and worcestershire for my taste.\\n\\nThe presentation of the crab cakes  was lovely. Three timbales of crab and peppers surrounded a small bunch of fresh greens bound by a tomato slice. The vinaigrette on the greens was a highlight.\\n\\nL\\'Academie has a notable wine selection. I was delighted to find Molly Dooker\\'s 2007 The Maitre D Cabernet Sauvignon on the list! Deliciously oaked goodness!\\n\\nTruth be told, it feels like a cross between a classroom and an average American bistro. But, you know what? That\\'s what it is... and, what better way to support young people who love food as much as we do and want to spend their career bringing it to us?!',\n",
       " \"My hubby and I had a great time here last night celebrating Christmas in July so I thought it was time to write an update.  SanTan Brewery has pretty much become our favorite place to hang out.  The food is good, the staff is great, and the beers are fantastic!  Some of the items on the menu are just OK but the real stars are the appetizers.  Our favorites are the nachos and the hummus.  Either of these could easily be a meal in and of themselves.  If you do order an entree you usually can't go wrong with whatever the daily special is.  Also, all the pizzas and burgers that we have tried have been really yummy.  But my favorite things to order are the grilled cheese or street tacos.  The servers are all very knowledgeable of the menu and also passionate about the beer.  They can make good recommendations on both fronts if you tell them what your preferences are and can usually offer ideas on pairings.\\n\\nThis place has a very chill vibe during the day.  It is a great spot for some relaxing day drinking, especially in the spring or fall when they roll up the big ice house style doors... so creating that inside, outside feeling.  They do have a kids menu but I have never seen any families here no matter what time it is.  Usually in the afternoon it is couples of all ages grabbing a bite while enjoying some shopping in downtown Chandler or else groups of friends just hanging out.  At night, it gets much more lively.  They frequently have a band or DJ starting at 10pm or so but even before that it can get so loud that it is difficult to carry on a conversation.  That is probably my only complaint about this place.  The concrete floors and lots of hard surfaces make the acoustics horrible.  Usually in the late evenings you will see more large, sometimes rowdy groups of 30-somethings occupying the tables and lots of singles of both genders milling around the bar.  Often on Friday or Saturday nights it is standing room only unless you call ahead for a table.  The servers are usually nice enough to bring drinks to those in the hostess area, so if you do get stuck waiting for a table it is not so bad.  They also use a smart system of taking your cell number instead of giving you a pager.  So, you can wander around the shops down the street instead, if you so desire, without fear of going out of range.  This is especially useful during the Thursday Farmers' Market, Third Friday Art Walk or other events put on by downtown Chandler.\\n\\nI really just can't say enough good things about this place.  I am leaving so much out in this review but check out their website if you want to see more about the cool events they do like Movie Mondays, trivia games, local bands and weekly guest beers.  You can also find more information about their beers which I think are by far the best craft brews produced in this state.  They have been really overlooked but are finally starting to get some recognition.  Don't take my word for it, though, get in there and try them for yourself.\",\n",

       " \"This is a solid little sub shop in Westgate Center. The ordering process is a little different from most places. Instead of walking up to counter and telling an employee what you want, you grab a brown bag off the wall and mark what you want with a Sharpe. It seems a little odd at first, but this actually helps speed up the process (which takes a little bit of time since all of the subs are toasted). \\n\\nLike any sub shop, there's a huge selection of meats and toppings, and you can stuff any sandwich with nearly anything you can think of. The price is also pretty good at less than 6 bucks. However, the basic sub is not enough to satisfy a normal appetite for more than an hour or two. Your best bet is to either get a side of chips, or go for extra meat (dollar upcharge), or double meat (2 dollar upcharge). That's really my only gripe with Which Which. I would give it four stars, but once you start paying for the extras, you're getting close to gourmet sandwich prices, for subs that are significantly smaller than Quizno's or Jimmy John's.  If you're looking for something sweet, I highly recommend a shake or malt.  It's way better at Which Which than at most burger places!\\n\\nOne thing to note, the employees here are always really friendly and cool. They deserve five stars. I've stopped by here a few times over the past couple of years, and never had a bad experience with any of them. They always seem to be having a good time behind the counter.\\n\\nIf you're heading to an event at the arena or stadium, this a great spot to grab a bite before heading in to save some cash on concessions.

Often, restaurants totally overcook portabellos and eggplant but this portobello, eggplant, and zucchini was tender (but not mushy) and tasted perfectly fresh. The herb goat cheese and slightly savory rye bread complemented each other and provided the perfect finishes to the delicious roasted vegetables.

       " 'Went here with the hubby last night for the first time with the Yelp International Supper Club. I had a great time meeting some fellow Yelpers and getting to try out a new place. I had seen this restaurant on Check Please! on PBS so it was already on my super-long and always growing \"to try\" bookmark list. \\n\\nWe started with spring rolls which tasted super fresh and delicious. They were the non-fried kind and there is nothing worse than when those get a little old and the rice paper starts to get crunchy instead of chewy. But these were perfect and came with a yummy dipping sauce. Also, there were huge whole shrimps in them instead of chopped or minced as some Asian restaurants use. The hubby got a beef noodle dish and I ordered Pho. Both were very tasty. I liked the fact that they gave you ample amounts of (very fresh) herbs and condiments to add to the soup to your liking. It reminded me of eating menudo at my MIL\\'s house. I was also very happy to see that they included sliced jalapenos on the garnish plate... even though I didn\\'t eat them outright as did some others at the table, I added them to the broth and let them steep a bit and it gave the perfect amount of spice to the pho. The bowl was so huge that I couldn\\'t finish it all but it was really good and left me with a satisfied but not too stuffed feeling. \\n\\nSince we got there late, I had ordered hurriedly so I was very surprised when I went up to pay and both our meals including tax and tip was still less than $10. Amazing! I seriously can not remember the last time I paid so little for a good meal. I pretty much never come to this part of town but if it was closer to where we live I would definitely make this place part of our regular rotation.  The staff was friendly and accommodating as well.  The only thing they would need for a fifth star is a nicer location/ambiance.',\n",

The booths are also big leather couches that give off the same vibe. But it all comes together in a cool modern kind of way. The chairs are comfortable, but there's big downside. I'm short, so the table was oddly high. \\n\\nCulinary dropout is also kind of small, so we waited a while to get a table, but once we ordered, the food came out ridiculously fast. But the it was really good, and the prices are pretty low (especially compared to the other places in the Waterfront/Fashion Square Mall area). \\n\\nThe cocktail menu is really impressive. I would definitely head back just to try the random assortment of drinks they make. Their Appetizer menu also has a lot interesting temptations. \\n\\nI would recommend Culinary Dropout as a perfect happy hour spot.

       " \"After passing Grand Lux Cafe about a hundred times, I finally had the chance to check it out. Knowing it was a sibling of Cheesecake Factory, I expected a similar menu. Upon entering, it had the same feeling as a Cheesecake. We sat down and the second the menu opened, realized, the menu was about as detailed as well! From sandwiches, to dishes from every culture imaginable, this restaurant definitely has something for everyone to choose from. \\n\\nAs the friendly waiter welcomed us, he told us about the menu and mentioned that Grand Lux focuses on serving different cultural cuisine from pretty much every region around. In one sitting you could try Thai, Chinese, Mexican and Italian. Yet, it wasn't actually as weird as it sounds. It really just depends on what your taste buds are in the mood for. However, the waiter did warn us that portions were large. How large? I was about to find out. \\n\\nWith so many options to choose from, I ended up going with the spicy flat bread chicken sandwich full of corn, avocado tomatoes and freshly grilled chicken. We had the chicken lettuce wraps to start. The second my meal arrived, I realized that friendly waiter was definitely not kidding when he said the portions were large. I think my sandwich equaled 2-3 full meals. The sandwich came in quarter flat breads and equaled nearly one full sandwich per each quarter. And they gave me four of them! The french fries heaped on the plate as well. I managed to eat one quarter of the sandwich and felt wasteful for not being able to finish the rest, but my waistline is already in a fight with me and the one quarter completely filled me up. However, when we sat down, friendly waiter mentioned the desserts (we should have just skipped right ahead) and said that they took a half an hour to prepare because they were freshly made. Who can pass up an opportunity to eat freshly made dessert so beignets it was. True to the theme of overly portioned items, they brought out eight (!!) large fist sized beignets steaming hot and oozing with freshly melting powdered sugar. To accompany them, they gave three dipping sauces. Heaven. That's all I can say. It was worth every bite...of the one I had. With six remaining, I wonder who could possible finish eight large beignets unless you are with a group of eight! \\n\\nAfter visiting Grand Lux, I definitely think more highly of it then I did the hundreds of times I passed it and I would absolutely go back again. But, I know now to listen to the man when he says the portions are big! So I'll just skip right ahead to dessert.\",\n",

My entree was meh- like I said I was starving so it did the job. No alcoholic beverages of any sort. Entree did come with either soup or salad (large salad) and either rice or fries. Had the rice and salad which were both alright. \\n\\nI did leave with leftovers but couldn't tell you if it was because i was just too full or my taste buds just weren't really diggin' what I was throwing in there. \\n\\nHeard about it, tried it, don't have it down in my datebook as of now to head back.\",\n",

The place, Vincent's Market Bistro is the scaled down version of the fine dining classic Vincent's of Camelback. It's funny that a place like this is so well hidden without even a hint of signage beyond a sandwich board on the street. Just look for the main Vincent's sign and follow it around back to the Market Bistro entrance, they're housed in the same building. \\n\\nChef and owner Vincent Guerithault keeps the menu decidedly French with hints of Southwestern flare that he's so famous for. You should look this guy up; he's got some accolades including a James Beard award under his belt. Does kudos translate to good cookery, you bet!\\n \\nFor one of my favorites, be sure to look for the Curly Endive Salad ($9) with mustard dressing, bacon, and a poached egg. I saw it, I ordered it, I swooned over it. A well balanced ratio of salty, sweet and sour then fresh cracked pepper completes the equation. \\n\\nPizza offerings are done well with a tender pale crust that seemed more akin to pastry then to your typical chewy crispy offering. Tarte FlambÃ©e ($8) was topped with a light cream sauce, bacon, onion and thyme. Another pork laden pizza was the Caprese ($8) topped with pesto, arugula, mozzarella and prosciutto. I just wished that the greens were put on after cooking instead of before.\\n\\nFor dinner you'll find classics including the cooked in its own fat Crispy Duck Confit ($16) with lentils and bacon, sensing a porky theme here? The tender mallard leg was succulent and intense in flavor while the lentils performed well by countering the richness of the meat. For something a little bit lighter, I use that word loosely, order up the Coq au Vin ($10). Red wine braised chicken served atop gratin potatoes were hearty and comforting. \\n\\nVincent's Market Bistro also offers a $20, 3 course Prix Fixe menu. On my last visit delights were abound with the likes of creamy Butternut Squash Ravioli, Rainbow Trout and a scrumptiously sour Lemon Tart. This has to be one of the best deals in town that I know of. I mean really, food from a James Beard award winning chef at these prices is unheard of. \\n\\nGreat food, good prices and excellent service all set in a romantic atmosphere, well; there is one caveat, the hours. Vincent's Market Bistro closes at 8pm, so plan on eating early. We arrived around 6pm on a Saturday night and by 7pm the place was completely filled.
